The ""Ardit way"" means: going back to the basics and re-learning everything from scratch but with a new, profound understanding of what's happening in the backstage. It means learning NOT by imitating but by acquiring the necessary structure and organized thought. It means FUN. It means not getting bored. It means making things look so EASY. Faleminderit!"

Every concept is well explained, so it's very friendly for those people who don't have programming experience before to learn. The pace of the courses are well designed, I never get confused or tired. Most of the bugs due to the upgrade of the third party libraries are easily fixed because of the update of the course, but there are still some ones sometimes cost me a while to understand and fix due to my special conditions. This course is a great start point if you want to learn the basic python developing, but if you want to be a master of python developing, there is still a long way to go. Thanks Ardit! I am glad to be one of your students."

There were areas where information could have been streamlined a bit through better editing. However, I learned so much through this course. The ability to test out of the beginner content is a pretty coll bonus. I tried out one of the other python courses that takes you from ""beginner to master"", but I found this course to be much better. You get exposed to lots of python libraries, a couple databases, and the flask framework. You also code in an IDE or the CL instead of spending most of your time in jupyter. This course provided me with a lot of ideas and code to bring into bigger projects and continue to improve my python skills. I highly recommend giving this course a try."

Wajdi"
The Python Course: OpenCV in Python,2021-03-14 16:15:42+00:00,5.0,Easily my favorite course on Udemy. Ardit not only covers the aspects of OOP in an engaging way but places them in context of workflows that one might encounter on their programming journey. Another exceptional feature is how he handles errors. Most instructors either ignore or provide a 'let's figure this out' approach. Ardit has carefully planned errors as teaching points which is a magnificent approach to help learner with what will happen to all coders.

The Python Course: OpenCV in Python,2021-02-22 22:41:52+00:00,5.0,"Fantastic course. I've done a couple of Python courses on Udemy before this one and they tell you how to do things, this course often tells you why as well. I feel I have gained a much deeper understanding. I may go back to the previous courses and see if I can get more out of them with these new found insights. If I had one very minor grumble it would be that Databases and SQL are not dealt with until th 10th App and I personally think are skirted over quite quickly, Still give it 5 stars though"

This course introduces each topic in a concise manner with practical examples and short interactive programming questions.  Once I can see why and how a topic works, the pieces fit together and build on each other with gradually complex exercises to solve.
I took advantage of Udemy's sale to purchase Ardit's new python OOP course and both python practice courses to continue my python learning after this course."

The explanations here can be a bit scattered and he doesn't necessarily go into all the detail you could on each topic and show all different possibilities.  However, he gives you enough to be dangerous with.  The biggest strength of this course is all of the coding exercises built in.  Lots of hands on experience to drill in what he shows, which helps to fill in gaps in explanation with practice.  Overall good stuff."

Thanks Ardit!!

as i go through other projects, i will update my review."

I'm not a complete programming beginner. My first language is AutoLISP, but also wanted to learn Python, which I have done a part of a course on. However, until this year I stopped for some time; but I wanted to start again. 
Having started this course I really like how the emphasis is on step by step understanding the process of programming in Python. If the rest of the course is similarly built, I will enjoy getting better in Python lots"

I was following another course specifically for testing using python but had tough times following not because the course was bad but because I didn't know much about OOP. At the right time - Udemy suggested this new course and I can relate to few things I had trouble understanding earlier. Ardit is a fantastic trainer and I like his training approach/method.  Explains stuff very clearly. Looking forward to completing the course and use the knowledge in building my test framework.

I really appreciate both the planned and unplanned errors within the lectures because Ardit helped you understand how to read the errors. Taking some other courses, I find it difficult, because the instructors do not tell you how to read the code to find your error.

I would say that since there is a lot of work with the course, it is better to do it over time than cram in a week, since for me that helps me practice (and remember what I did previously)"

The Python Course: OpenCV in Python,2021-01-18 21:42:04+00:00,5.0,"My learning experience with this course so far has been amazing for me.  This is unlike any other programming course out there.  Ardit teaches you several ways of solving a problem and the reason why one is the best way to solution. You will NOT be bored to death with the same old repetitive lessons on basics, variables, loops etc. etc...   

This course adapts project based learning. I was looking for this style of teaching specifically and I am happy that Ardit has put his time and effort to build a course this way. This course truly teaches you how to be a good Python developer.  The way he structured the course into projects/apps and the concepts building on top of each other is pretty neat. I didn't feel like I am doing  a course, rather, the experience is more like you are building some applications using python, while coding alongside the instructor and learning new concepts along the way. 

Some good things about this course for me:

1. Project based learning truly stands out.
2. Learn the way true developers do code. Know how to approach the problem and the solution
3. Building something truly usable, while learning a concept.
4. OOPS concepts as the core. Keep in mind, developers build everything in terms of OOPS in real world projects. 

Somethings, which are not so great and can improve:
1. Exercises seem to be too easy. 
2. Not for the absolute beginners. You still need to have a basic idea of programming. I mean, the very basic concepts like if conditions, variables, loops and other basic concepts of programming. 

I personally don't see the cons listed above to impact the core idea of this course in any way. I am very happy to take this course and I look to forward to the next courses from Ardit. Thank you Ardit !"

The presenter, Ardit Sulce  has done a good job. I have only done 15% so far and I have learnt a lot. There are coding exercises and quiz as you go along which means that you are checking if you have truly understand what you are doing.  It say it is 25 hours in total so it is a good value for money. I recommend that you will need longer than this if you are coding along the course like me. I am looking forward to making the 10 real-world applications. Thank you Ardit for making the course."

The coding exercises are very helpful in the way that they require a practical application of the skills from the current section, but also from previous sections. This method of stacking basic building blocks is a great way to start understanding how code in general tends to stack in real life application. The answers to the coding exercises are not always explicitly taught to you before hand, but you are taught the methods to find these answers for yourself within the python documentation. So rather than practicing rote memorization, you are actively problem solving towards a tangible goal."

Also the approach Ardit took with showing that errors and crashes is something typical for the programming process and the students should learn how to work through the errors is really great. 

The final project was not complex, the only thing I stuck upon was about how to put the table 
into HTML page. It was not obvious for me, that I can simply create an empty placeholder in the HTML
page and then fill-it in upon rendering the page. I tried to create a new HTML-page and embed it or use
the jinja template but it had not worked. Also Ardit added the check-ups if the uploaded file is indeed of csv type and content, while I simply checked if file contains the address column.

I really loved the course.
The only thing I can suggest for the course improvement is to add even more exercises or another project for self-practice.

Many thanks Ardit!"

The Python Excercises:Data Processing by use of Python,2020-12-23 12:13:54+00:00,2.5,"Course gives a high level overview of data processing and analysis capabilities of python using spyder and jupyter but some of the code/methods used in key lectures are outdated. For example, use of ""sns.pt"" no longer works with latest version of  seaborn; the "".ix"" method has been depreciated. Researching why these methods did not work and finding alternatives was a good way to learn but I would have struggled if I had not done the comprahensive python basics course before starting this course. Anyone starting this course need to have atleast a basic understanding of python.

The course should also come with a warning asking students to first check if packages like numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib have already installed when anaconda3 was installed by entering the command '!pip list' in iPython. For some reason these packages will not appear when you type 'pip list' in cmd and if you install them again using cmd as the course lectures suggests you may end up installing the packages twice or overriding existing installation and this may corrupt your anaconda installation. This is also true for jupyter which is installed along with anaconda. There is no need to install it again using cmd, this will mess up the existing installation. I learnt this the hard way and had to uninstall everything and reinstall a clean version of anaconda again."

The Python Excercises: From Beginner to Expert,2020-12-19 01:25:27+00:00,5.0,"Excellent way to get acquainted if you are a good self learner. The course goes through most of the basics in a satisfying way and you should come away able to program more fluently if you are new.

The UI is great as you do not need to compile in your own program which is similar to other code challenge websites. The gamification makes it more motivating. The instructor clearly improved it from the first version (which is also quite good on its own merits)

Just reference the docs and try to use google if you cannot figure it out.

Only downside is its 100% for beginners, i would have loved a bit more intermediary stuff in it. But that is only because i really enjoyed how thorough and progressive it felt.

Overall, excellent course. Great to pair with a theory course for a more well rounded learning experience."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-12-13 17:00:11+00:00,5.0,this course is very helpfull for me to learn python programming.
The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-12-13 15:26:38+00:00,4.5,"This is a nice course. Building severals apps and doing practical things from early on is very enjoyable and gives great motivation. 
The last /biggest projects of the course are web-apps using flask. To me those were not that interesting, as I don't want to get into that area. Still, I'm happy to have done them and having finished them gives me a sense of accomplishment. 
Thanks Ardit & Team! You course really kept me going :)"

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-12-08 13:42:00+00:00,5.0,"I was looking for some time for the good Python course for beginners and I wanted to find something with real projects in it. After checking the contents and reviews of the courses I decided to choose this course. First I was concerned about the strange accent of the trainer but after few lectures, I got used to it and it's actually really clear English. Way that Ardit is explaining things is really clear, he is also going forward in quite slow tempo at the beginning which is good, later on he is speeding up and so does the knowledge of the student as well. Don't skip the basics -section at the beginning even if you pass the test. These lectures are really good even if you know something about Python. There's theory and then exercises that are supporting the theory. And structure is really well built. Now I have done few projects and it seems that in this course you will learn the basics and also what you can do with Python. And then later on you can focus on the areas that you want to learn more. Only minus is that some of the recordings are quite old (from 2015-2016 I believe). But if something has changed since, then there's usually comments in the course that tell what has changed since the recording was made. Also some sections have been added afterwards to support the course. So far this is the best Udemy course that I have done. And I have done around 10 in the past."

and this course you need to have previous experience in python, not for the beginners, and all applications he said we will build together was so week and not for real-life use and he gave a small explanation for each

I feel I wasted my time with this course"

For instance, there are gaps in explaining method use before you use them on a quiz (you have seen some but not the one you need to use and it may not work the way you expect so you'd have to do some research to understand it) or gaps like not explaining what a tuple is and its characteristics- what is for? how are they different? Why would you use them? But overall he does a good job of explaining concepts."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-10-14 10:51:50+00:00,5.0,This is my first course on Udemy.  I found the instructor explains things well and in detail.  I've had no problems with code not working.  Sometimes if you don't understand a new concept keep watching because I found the instructor would sometimes explain it a different way a few minutes later.  The course covers a lot of material and gives you a good foundation to build your knowledge further out on your own.

The Python Excercises: From Beginner to Expert,2020-10-13 21:55:02+00:00,5.0,Excellent - getting small code examples to actually work is very useful for learning - particularly interesting to see how the  instructor code differs in the harder examples and I found this helpful in seeing how comprehensions can simplify code - introduction of JSON and REGEX to solve some problems without prior introduction was tricky as I'd never heard of them -also a bit silly to have 1 question quizes - better to batch them less frequently. Overall reasonable value for money and I have become a better coder over the few days it has taken to complete the course

So far for the good news.
Bad:
- text swims out of focus and that has nothing to do with my wifi connection
- the code wasn't prepared beforehand, so errors occur and are corrected during the course which leads to unnecessary length of the lecture and results in flaws in the structure - don't misunderstand me, that the coding is done while the next step is explained is great, and some editing, eg cutting out the mistakes would have been an additional courtesy, which is definitely missing
- Section 4, Bokeh Server, black background, tiny font size, not readable at all, then swimming out of focus and these corrections on the fly when the code doesn't work on the first try is really poor quality
- ColumnDataSource is explained nicely, but not taken to its full advantage, eg. 3 CDS are created when one would have been enough - also CDSview is missing
- Q&A is not answered

I just finished Section 4 -  my feedback in between"

However, lots of outdated content, some programs don't work, instructor switches to different application in the middle of the course, some questions remain unanswered while various explanations are not very clear.

When instructor makes mistakes, he doesn't even bother to reupload the clean video, instead add notes, in some instances there were over 2 notes and additional comments added. Such a mess.

This course is a good introduction to Python but be aware of unclear explanations, program not installing and ultimately there will be errors in your code and YOU WILL HAVE TO SOLVE THEM on your own.!"

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-09-23 16:40:17+00:00,4.0,"Hello,

The course is thorough and covers a broad range of applications and uses for Python. I definitely found knowledge that will be  useful for personal projects that I want to build. 

The largest piece of feedback I would give would be that the course depends A LOT on MANY DIFFERENT libraries, dependencies, and external software or platforms (Postgres, Heroku, all the libraries, etc.). As someone completely new to Python/programming when I started the course I didn't even understand what a library was, why I was downloading it, where it was being saved on my computer, and at times as I moved through the course I sometimes wasn't sure if the syntax and methods I was using were vanilla Python or part of a library. 

I'm not against using libraries in order to complete real world projects, and I realize modern programming requires a great deal of external dependencies and platforms. However, it would have been helpful to have a more thorough explanation of what they are, how they are used, and how to use and understand Pip before jumping into libraries. Also, more projects based on core Python functions and methods and the included Python libraries would have been nice before jumping into so many external libraries. This would have helped me keep things more organized in my head as I went through the course. 

Beyond that that I think this was a great introductory course!

Thanks for everything!"

I learned so much from Ardit that I look at Python fairly differently now. The focus of the class is less on abstract or technical aspects and more on the practical. The latter half of the class, once you start developing the apps, introduces you to a different package (or two) almost every lesson. This is where it really shines because it taught me a lot of important skills, foremost among them: a familiarity with the command line for things like virtual environments and git, and an awareness of modules and APIs like Flask, pandas, BeautifulSoup and Jupyter Notebook. One warning for some of these is that the amount you get out of the class depends on how much you put into it. I took a very proactive approach, and I learned a lot. For that reason, I’d highly recommend the course.

For the disadvantages of the course, there are two: 1. most of the module knowledge in the latter part is more about accomplishing what you need to do rather than understanding exactly what the packages are capable of and why, and 2. there were a few concepts I think could be expanded on more. I think both of these problems are because the focus is mostly on practicality and useful knowledge. For the first problem, this course does put a heavy emphasis on using the internet, documentation and outside tutorials to help you, which seems to be a good idea in general but especially in programming.

As for the latter, some of the content feels like it could benefit from more emphasis on inheritance and testing. Inheritance is the big one here, considering how heavily something like Django relies on it. As for testing, it’s pretty much absent from the course. It is a more in-depth thing and something that doesn’t lend itself easily to the current structure of the class, but I think some lessons on it would be a nice addition.

But these problems don’t stop me from very strongly praising this course. A lot of the lessons seems to come from the angle of practical applications and perspectives the professor has had to use in his professional work. I learned a lot about how to approach problems, how to solve your errors, and how to figure things out on your own."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-09-08 13:07:54+00:00,5.0,"I finished the course and here is my thought.
I would say this course goes beyond my expectation. There is some part more interesting to me than the others.
However, it's very nice to learn and see what Python can do. All modules in this course help building your python skill as a programmer. 
The apps that we made are proper in term of complexity, difficulty, and time limit. This course really get your hands dirty. It's a real learning by practicing course and not simply syntax learning.
I also like instructor's manner. He is quite funny and easy to listen to. You will see many errors happening here and there in this course. Personally, I think it's not a bad thing because you see how to fix it (or google) and be familiar with the exceptions which is part of programming job..fixing bugs or try out solutions. 
Last but not the least is Q&A support, I would say it's second to none. Course Assistant is super supportive and respond in short time. He does pay attention to help and give advices to students.
Thank you Ardit for such a big amazing course and David for your kind support to students.
I look forward for The Python Mega Course: Season2!"

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-09-06 21:52:01+00:00,3.5,"I stuck with this course despite not having a promising start. Perhaps I was too critical at first, but overall I don't see much value in it over and above other similarly priced courses. Mr. Sulce is clearly a talented programmer, but lacks in his ability to clearly and accurately communicate concepts in a way that stimulates learning, instead preferring to simply show the finished product and tell students ""This is what you do."" He spends very little, if any, time instructing on ""This is why we do it that way,"" which is the most important aspect of teaching. Moreover, each of these disparate apps are assembled seemingly at random, rather than building on and expanding concepts learned in previous apps. If you want basic instruction on how to assemble apps like these and already have a foundational knowledge of Python, perhaps there is value here, but if you're looking to actually master Python from nothing, this will not get you there. The teaching style and the subject matter is not conducive to that end.

Edit:

After finishing the course, and in reply to Mr. Sulce's response, I have decided to up my rating slightly. To his credit, Mr. Sulce's teaching style actually improves the farther you progress in the course. Perhaps these lectures were constructed over a longer period of time. I stand by what I said, though perhaps I could have phrased it differently. 

Here's the thing: if these apps are useful to you, then this course will teach you how to build them. However, what I did not find here was foundational knowledge in the libraries and resources used to build them. The lectures are structured as code-alongs. There's nothing wrong with that, but I disagree with Mr. Sulce's intimation that this method will leave you with conceptual knowledge, something that, as a teacher myself, I can say is very important to learning a craft as complex as programming.

When you go to an art school, you don't go to a class and draw pictures with your teacher line by line. Your end result might be some pretty pictures, some pictures you could hang up and be proud of, but you haven't gained anything that you can then translate into novel art, beyond perhaps knowledge of the types of pens and ink and paper you can use.

Saying there is no value here was perhaps too harsh, and I would rescind that statement, but I think it's important to understand what exactly is on offer here."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-09-01 18:02:50+00:00,3.0,"At Section 129 of 350 I must say that the course is doing the same thing as many others have said:

FALLING APART.  He is introducing things like CSV and JSON, and not even really introducing those topics.  On top of that, he switches to using the Atom editor, and you can hardly see anything that's typed into the editor because the video is faded out.  He's jumping all over the place.

At this place I feel this should have been titled ""Introduction to Python, and Other Topics"".  It's a great introduction to Python, or programming in general, the first half, but things quickly become average as soon as he starts the CSV section.

Update: Section 132 of 150
I am puzzled as to why he is repeating basic Python information he taught earlier in the course, when the time could be better used to focus on creating the program.  I'm struggling to keep my attention at this point, and I've been running the videos at 1.25x speed to do so, and it's a real struggle."

I especially liked how the instructor took his time to explain - and re-explain - even the ""simplest"" concepts; makes it VERY easy to understand not only what we're doing but why we're doing it, too!

The real issue I have is the lack of OO methodology used. There is a brief section touching on it, but otherwise, none of the example modules make use of it. While this makes it easier to understand for learning purposes and is good early on, I was expecting to make use of classes and separate scripts in later sections to help re-enforce this concept. The lack of OO is a big problem for anyone hoping to translate these skills to real-world jobs, as most programming positions I've seen demand it as a way of making code reusable across projects, and OO is difficult for beginners to wrap their heads around, so this would've been invaluable practice for those unfamiliar with it."

I've been in the ""tutorial hell"" for ages, just watching and coding very simple things that were not really connected to anything in the real world, and here I have finally found what I was looking for. This is not just working on python, but also with so many other libraries. It really gives you the step by step guidance on how to create real apps and programs. I just wish there were more than 10 projects, because Ardit does a superb work in teaching how to code. 10/10"

Not everyone is a teacher, and unfortunately Ardit falls firmly in this category. No doubt the lecturer has an advanced understanding of Python, but lacks the ability to communicate this knowledge in an effective manner and structured manner.

Continuous instances of oversight of knowledge communication (i.e. assumptions made about users knowledge and ability to interpret situations), additional step/file inclusions from one video to the next, and the teacher doesn't even acknowledge the views are different, let alone explain the purpose for the change. Such offenses are honestly too numerous to list. 

In conclusion, this course is not suitable for people with no prior coding experience. I would not recommend to anyone in this position."

I started learning here due to an interest in making a small app for myself, but have now found it way more useful in my day to day life. I am an architect, and never imagined using coding as a tool to be more efficient at work. These projects have helped me to realise opportunities to streamline mundane tasks and have a few fun projects in between. Not only that, I have also been able to find new avenues of interest within architecture through coding. This course is absolutely amazing for beginners.

Thank you Ardit and thank you to your team for answering my many questions!

until now Ardit my course instructor has shown some tips, tricks and the basics to python. as he said in the preface that this is a action course and i do really feel like it. going to take back whatever knowledge i learn here. looking forward to develop those 10 real world applications."

Overall, if you are an absolute beginner or you know python but have zero web development experience, this might be a nice start. It gives you a sense of how everything relates to each other. One thing I don’t like about though: the instructor barely told you why a certain step is needed but let you simply follow through. The projects are still toy projects - don’t expect too much from the title “real world applications”."

Before I took this course, I found that programming was so difficult and didn't know how to apply what I have learnt......

The apps built in this course are really ""Real World Applications"" that I can use for solving real-life problems. Although I am not a Python programmer or a data scientist, I can at least make a Desktop Bookstore for myself, and enhance the data visualization for my job. 

In addition, I could find most the answers in Q&A part when I had difficulty. Thank Audit, David and others!"

Maybe make an appropriate UI where you can navigate to the different projects.

At first, I did not like the jumping around between IDEs, but the exposer to different issues. Helped me understand how to install packages beyond what I have used before. The different environments became teaching by accident. 

David the TA is spot on with questions. This is the most responsive course I have taken on the internet. Great work David.
Ardit makes mistakes, that is one of my favorite parts of this course. Being guided through a problem and understanding the errors is very good practice for my own projects.

I was among the 60% who lost interest in Programming because it felt like all greek to me. Ardit is a great teacher who takes us patiently through the concepts, with exercises along the way. He explain the what and why beautifully. And the program projects are simply awesome. He breaks down each problem in a small video and ultimately when we see the complete program that we built, it feels amazing. Breaking the program into smaller problems and then writing codes is excellent way to learn. Final output may seem complex to beginners, but it is made of simple short codes. This is beautifully explained by Ardit."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-06-26 20:10:42+00:00,4.5,"The course was amazing. The project oriented dynamics is the best way to learn anything, and see how things work. The teacher is clear on his lectures and gives tips to understand better the code he is writing. There were two lectures that I found a little bit complicated: the mobile app caused me trouble the most, but was not Ardit's fault. It was caused for the version of both python and the OS, and I think this lecture should be updated for the last python's version. The final lecture of web database application is quite heavy, maybe he could divided in two parts, so SQLAlchemy can be explain with more patience. At the end, I think this is a great course, and I'm really pleased with all the background I obtained into python's world. Thank you Ardit for your teaching, and David for answering my questions."

First, the instructor uses a regular zoomed out view in his IDE which makes it hard to read his text. Second, he got an annoying verbal tic (hmm). Furthermore, it is clear that he is not an experienced python programmer. However, you don't need to be an expert to teach basic of bokeh. The course still gives a kicks-start to starting with bokeh, but probably not that much better than reading the docs."

Ardit presents everything in a very well-paced and accessible manner, shows you a lot of great extra modules you'll need, and shows you some of the errors and mistakes that might show up and how to look at and fix them. Ardit occasionally make mistakes, just like you will, and shows you how to find them. I don't think I'm anywhere near being a great programmer, but I was making my own smaller apps before this course was even done, and I can look at code and understand it very well now. This is a solid course to get you off and running."

The example programs are excellent and perfect for beginners.  Ardit explains things very thoroughly along with the reason why something is done this way or not.  I love being able to ask a question and get answers in a reasonable time. I am disappointed that my version of Python does not work with pyinstall, but such is the life of a programmer. 

After completing the course, I was not disappointed.  I did get frustrated about 3/4 through the course when I had trouble getting things to work as taught in the class.  I finally downgraded my version of Python to match a version that the instructor said worked for them and things were better.  There were still a few things that did not work right due to version differences in external libraries, but the instructor was able to point out where the problem was and how it works now."

(For example pip3 install wxpython not working under Ubuntu 20.04, you need to know how and what libraries you need to install first for it. Some other problems like it, but mostly not really important.)"

Plenty of opportunities to apply your skills in understandable exercises, very easy to understand the concepts, but as soon as you are done with the basics, everything falls apart. The content beyond the basics is very old and outdated, it's jumping all over the place, there are no exercises to apply the knowledge, and the knowledge itself is presented in a very poor way. It's basically copy and paste without understanding the concepts and functions. It's like there are 2 different courses: the first one (the basics of Python) being amazing, and the second one (everything else, the reason to take the course) very poor at best. I would recommend the creator of the course to update the course, add a lot more exercises and explain every step of the way very carefully. I’m disappointed..."

The Python Course: Interactive Visualizations,2020-05-17 12:25:33+00:00,3.5,"This is very nice course however with one serious drawback: the code is depricated in a number of scripts provided in the course. It was still manageble nearly up to the last chapter, but when one is trying to combine Bokeh server and Flask in order to get a web-based application it just did not work. A number of other students were trying and one can read their comments, but no success and unfortunately no help from the teacher. Such courses need to be updated periodically when new versions of Bokeh/ Python are introduced and computer operation systems are getting upgraded. Despite of all above this is very nice introduction to interactive graphics with Bokeh. But Teacher, please update the course!"

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-05-17 08:30:17+00:00,5.0,"A brilliant course for anyone starting out on their Python learning journey.  I would particularly recommend it for people, like myself, who need to see how what they are learning could be applied in the real world or those who do far better by learning by doing.  The course explains concepts well and if you do have a query it has normally already be asked and answered in the Q&A.  I believe you'd struggle to find a better course for getting started learning Python!

Its biggest strength to me could also be its biggest weakness to others.  As it covers such a vast array of real world use cases you get introductions to a decent number of Python libraries rather than an in-depth view into a couple of them.  As far as I'm concerned the exposure to such varied real world use scenarios is a huge bonus because it shows you whats possible in Python and gives you enough knowledge to get started using anything shown in this course.

If you're looking for more practice following this course the tutor also has what i consider a good follow on course - ""100 Python Exercises: Evaluate and Improve your Skills"".  It gets you applying a lot of what you learn in this course and re-enforces it."

I didn't  know how. I googled for it but I think was asking the wrong question. I know it was elementary and the other teachers might have thought it unnecessary to mention so I didn't know.

The Python Course: From Beginner to Expert,2020-05-14 12:04:56+00:00,2.0,"TLDR: If you're an *actual beginner* with Python, look elsewhere.

I purchased this course as an introduction to programming.  I'm nearly finished with each module, but don't feel comfortable with the language to begin the final two steps.  There are multiple modules here where the instructor uses certain code without explanation, and times when definitions for built in commands weren't explained; things I would think a beginner course would include, you don't know what you don't know after all.  To boot, the instructor hasn't answered questions in modules, not just from myself, for at least 6 months.  How are prospective students supposed to trust this course when the instructor won't even respond?!

I suppose it makes sense though.  I was fortunate to find this course on sale for $11 during a deep discount promotional period, but it's priced at ~$50 normally; it's the least expensive Python course on Udemy.  You get what you pay for."

Couple of inputs:
1. I would expect exercises to be ordered from beginner to advanced. 
2. Also, i think more explanations would have not hurt in the solution sections, not just read through
3. I do not see the positive effect of having some of the exercises written and others in video format - either have all of them in video or written."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-05-08 08:27:44+00:00,3.5,"I would like to start by saying that this is my personal subjective opinion. Any other student should think about their level and expectation before judging and choosing this course. To some it might fit better so some worse than me. Nevertheless do not forget that a lot of effort was put behind to put together all this content.
About me: I am a CS graduade from 20 years ago that developed into the direction project / process manager, lost contact with coding and want now to get back into it. I have a solid principles foundation, although this foundation was layed 20-25 years ago. Some of the priciples have changed in the meanwhile.
Now the good: this course its a swiss army knife with a lot of tools. One will learn various things from basic python usage up to graphs, GIS, web apps, scrapping and so on.
Now the bad: as you know a swiss army knife has a lot of tools but none of them is as good as a dedicated tool. It will help you when you are in need but will not do for serious stuff, for this you will need the appropriate tool (in this analogy you will need to go deeper, muuuch deeper in the subject as it was done in this course). I also missed some connection to some basic principles that, I presume, are taken as granted and I do not know if this is appropriate for a beginners course. The topics should not be fully handeled here but there should be at least referenced. Another thing that bodered me is the quality of the recording. If I can understand that such a big course was recoreded on different machines and environments, it is difficult to bear with the change into volume aplitute between lectures. On one side. On the other side the lecturer has a habit to tut-tut, making a sound with the tongue and the teeth that in the end I could not bear anymore....
I hope this feedback to help both the maintainers of the course as also the future potential students.
Good luck on your Python-Way!"

This tutorial was what I expected. Only it was hard to manipulate datas because I install the new version QGIS 3 Bucuresti."

The instructor is obviously passionate about Python and teaching.  The lessons, however, are at times in-cohesive.  The progression of concepts isn't right for me (maybe good for someone else).  Also, the instructor doesn't seem to always know where he is going with a concept from the beginning.  For example, when he was trying to find a mean function.  It is possible that he knew it wasn't there and was trying to make a  point, but that wasn't clear to me when I was watching the lesson."

For me, I have enrolled myself in a few other courses in Udemy but this is the first one I have finished although some other courses I started a year ago but never finished. I liked how there was lots of practice and it definitely was challenging especially when I would follow the instructions exactly but still have to look in stackoverflow or github on how to deal with certain issues (old/new). The most problematic for me was trying to install postgresql but there was always a problem. After 5 hours of trying to resolve the issue with postgresql by all means, I decided to use MySQL with the help of pymysql library and it worked just fine. Thank you for making it so interesting that I never let a single issue stop me from completing every lesson successfully."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-04-26 18:59:24+00:00,5.0,"Excellent course, and given its massive and varied content, it's very good value for money. Of course, as libraries are updated all the time, certain sections of the course are out of date and you will find yourself Googling for solutions, but THIS IS PART OF THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE. In fact, Ardit included a section on how to look for help online, and how to structure your question in order to optimise the chances of getting a fast and proper response. And if all else fails, you can post lecture-specific questions. For me, it's the hands-on approach that made a big difference compared to some other online courses I took. I will now be moving on to one of Ardit's '100 exercises' as practice is the only way to really learn. Thanks Ardit, you've helped me on my way, but you've also made me realise there is so much more to learn!"

For example, the Open Layers plugin described was applicable for QGIS 2, but is not yet available for the current version QGIS 3. Had to do some google searching to find a solution to follow along. Additionally, the Census bureau has completely changed, including the deprecation of factfinder.census.gov. Very hard to follow along since the information is no longer in the same places, or available at all."

The hints and the solution section are a boon when you have almost given up. Keep up the good work and think of adding R and SQL also in your course arsenal."

The parts about creating a website and deploying it were expecially fascinating to me: having a website you've built you can send to your friends feels amazing. I'll have to study HTML and css a bit more in order to build even better things, but this was a great introduction. The final project put my skills to test, although I was only able to make part of it it still felt great seeing how much I had learnt. This course introduces many skills, and it will take practice for me to be able to master them all, but it's been very useful. Very recommended!"

Managed to learn everything he thought except the camera detection which I'm not interested in. I've been trying the other courses I bought and now disappointed as I've been comparing them to this course/instructor. This is very good start for those who have no knowledge at all in programming. Bonus: very active in the Q&A too. Bought his 2 other Python exercises courses too and finished them all.

Update:  I'm about 55% through the course.

No doubt Ardit knows his stuff.  He shares a lot of good information.  Sometimes his transitions between topics is a bit rough.  Also, when he starts some lectures it seems he is talking about the subject without even a brief introduction on the topic to get a student oriented as to where we're going in that lecture.

Given that English is likely not his first language, the course is all the more impressive."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-04-08 19:08:36+00:00,3.0,"Overall, I'm learning some of the basics for ""how to write"" Python code and use some third party packages and dissect how to determine what a given function/method/etc can do.  What I'm missing so far is ""how to USE"" Python in the real world, aka, how to apply the knowledge in a useful manner.
Several of the course practices are set up awkwardly, with the help/hints for accomplishing the practice not supplied until the next lecture.  For me, it would be preferable to ""pause"" the course and the exercise stage and be able to see the help/hints without having to continue to the next phase of the course.  The current setup makes me feel like I have to continue without completing the exercise, in order to complete the exercise."

The pace is fast for me personally and I am having to go back and rewatch lessons a few times. This is because certain videos on more complex topics should be longer than 2 - 4 minutes allowing for a more in depth explanation. Thankfully exercises are plentiful, giving me an ample amount of time to practice what I am learning. Furthermore, the structure of the course, giving the student real world experience through building applications and exercises, is executed very well apart from the video nitpick. In conclusion, this hands on course is quite valuable and will arm you with all the tools you need to efficiently write python!"

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-03-27 13:58:39+00:00,4.5,"Learning a lot of packages from python like flask, tkinter and sql interfaces.
Especially the html part I can't follow along so well. I have only a basic understanding of html and css but I never used syntax like {{url_to(function)}}
Also it would be a great improvement of the understanding, if only the references have the same name.
E.g. there are very often a lot of variables and functions with the same name, but only one or the other will be referenced. Out of the html code or from an other part of the python code.
Thank you very much for the great course, gave me a lot of insights in various packages and I will definitly use sql as well as the tkinter library to create an own project.
Cheers"

Only improvements would be with the profile website; I'd like to know how to upload my Python projects so that they can be viewed by future employer. Also, as a bonus, I'd like to learn how to add a live interpreter to my website so that you can run the code in the browser to see how it works.  Finally, a lesson on machine learning would be a good finish to the course as Python is widely used in AI."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-03-14 13:20:16+00:00,4.0,"I am an experienced programmer, refreshing on Python, which I have used in the past, and getting to know the basic, most used libraries that I have never used. I usually start the lesson and go on writing the program just before it is being done in the video, as an exercise. The lessons and variety of cases is quite good, but there are a few things that I would have changed:

1. Every lesson should be dated. Tool versions will vary if following a 2016 lesson in 2020. It would help the student to know that a bug or visual difference may be due to a version change rather than their own code. I have to add that I didn't have much problems with that, but I've been trying to figure out more or less the timeframe of each video for this reason.

2. There should be more exercises within and after lessons so that the students memorize patterns. This started off quite well in the first few chapters but the exercises grew thinner or nonexistent as time went on. I understand that exercises for a more complex app are difficult or impossible to evaluate, but something could be done.

3. More Python! The focus was on Python for a few chapters and then shifted to libraries. This is very interesting but, again, students would need more exercises for Python skills, more problems that should involve pythonesque ways of doing things. Perhaps I will see more of this in the following chapters!

4. It's pronounced ""tee-kay-inter""!

Please take this as constructive criticism. I am happy with the course, thank you!"

As an experienced programmer, I wanted to get a good ideas of Python's capabilities using real-world examples.  The instructor is clear and thorough in his explanations.  He states several times that he may go a bit long with explanations, but he really wants you to understand the topic.  I stopped short of 5 stars, only because a few of the samples didn't go as shown, but it wasn't so much that I couldn't get the idea and I even work some of them out by Googling the error or topic.  Again happy I chose this course and feel like if I do some Python work I have a great reference to go to in this course."

I've now reached ""half-way"" in the course...

Section 229 - 236 is very confusing. The web links are no longer the same as the tutorial videos, which makes this hard to follow. I'm pretty disappointed at this section."

It's a great course and I would recommend it to people who know some python and they want to cement that learning"

I appreciate the flask part but think it might be better to have flask section as a separate course. All in all it was worth it even if its Bokeh has moved a few versions on.

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-02-24 13:55:02+00:00,5.0,"I was asked by few students to review this course and I will say it is a very good course that is rich in material and rich in common applications. 

It is very hard to watch on mobile screens which is something that should not be acceptable in our age. The idea of Udemy and similar platforms courses is you learn on the go. A simple effective zooming during screen cast could have solved this problem quite easily. That has been said, the instructor included many exercises that maybe are meant to be completed on a PC. Although I took and reviewed hundreds online courses on different platforms including Udemy, where they have programming exercises that work perfectly on mobile devices and tablets. 

The course is called ""Mega"", so it should be at that level. The coverage of OOP is very limited, I would say primitive. It would have been nice if the course has covered essential concepts such as Dunder methods (why they exist), multiple constructors since students would think that what was explained would be the only way it is done, abstract base classes, encapsulation, composition, aggregation, multiple inheritance is not covered only single inheritance is covered in a very shallow way ,  so no mention of super() even, (there are some interesting problems that arise in multiple inheritance). Student encounter these OOP when looking at the code of many famous libraries they use. Other beginner/intermediate level concepts such as threading, the Python debugger, the Enumerate function, iterators, generators, decorators, lambda functions which are mentioned very briefly, the filter,reduce, map functions are also very essential for a good foundation in Python.

All in all this course is in reality classified as a good absolute beginner level course. You can say it is a comprehensive introductory course on Python programming with more hands on practice approach which what I liked about it. As a student, you have to supplement it with learning more intermediate to advanced concepts mentioned in this comment."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-01-31 19:05:38+00:00,5.0,One of the very best courses ever. A very subtile progression from scratch to advanced Python features. The choice of programming exercises is very clever and bound to real life needs.
The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2020-01-31 18:27:24+00:00,4.5,"Great course. Probably it is not aimed at those kind of people who want to know Python from scratch. It is perfect for people who have already consolidate the basics and all the features, types, statements and all the Python universe, and they want to do some useful and interesting practise, which is this course. However, this course contains a introduction part about the fundamentals of Python, but obviously and for the sake of the length of the course, it is very basic and limited, just for refresh some concepts.

I am very strict in the academic field, but this is a great choice, and a worthwhile course."

I want to say that I knew the basics of programming(C++) so for me it been easy to understand the python basics. But for a begginer will be a little bit hard because the basics are very fast pace showed.

Also what I like is that the apps are quite basics and can be improved, so for me is a good start to have a basic app and starting for it I can develop it further and learn.

I put 4,5 stars because I think that is not very easy for a complete beginner to understand because the explanations are not very detailed all the time. But for me with prior programming experience(even if in other langauge) is ok."

I understood the basic syntax before starting the course but this course has begun to solidify the basic concepts in a way that I can build my own small programs. The way he builds in real world applications allows exposure to the available libraries within Python which I had no idea existed. The applications begin to teach how to apply/scale these libraries into programs which has sparked further interest in Python for me. I can't wait to finish and continue to develop more complex programs.

Sidenote about Section 2 part 6, if you are unsuccessful at running python via CMD when typing just python you will need to use py -3 as you mentioned. The same thing is true for when you call it up from the terminal within Visual Studio Code. Also worth mentioning that windows 10 starts the Microsoft Store when python does not work in CMD."

Many of the ""real life projects"" that are in the tutorial can hardly be made without  walking through the videos - that are basically watching and imitating the mentor writing the code because he hasn't given us any chance of even start building the project on our own.

Ardit has made this course so interesting by intentionally making mistakes and going back to correct them. For a person like me it creates opportunity for learning by ""spotting the pitfalls"" .
I definitely recommend anyone starting to learn Python. It is a good start for me.  Thank you."

I've started to study python recently. I've done some free tutorial and other Udemy tutorials but this is the most comprehensive by far. 

Ardit not only teaches you do code but he teaches you to find the answers yourself. So from the word go you learn to have the confidence do it yourself. 

Thank you Ardit!"

So as I have read in FAQ section there are some coding issues (using deprecated funtions for example).

Instructor is good so maybe updating some coding and lectures will make the course more attractive for future students willing to learn Python from this course."

I am now approximately 3 days in and 1/3 done with the course.  Phenomenal value!!!!! Even at the full price of almost $200 this course is well worth the money.  So far this seems to be comparable to an online course from a regular university, except having the option to hyper focus on a single subject seems to be a more efficient way to absorb the knowledge.

I just love the way the instructor solves problems gradually and I think that is vital in solving programming problems or any other problem in general. Tacking the problem piece by piece and gradually seeing the final result take shape.

Python libraries are like a level of abstraction to me but at the same time you need cognition in using those libraries properly and achieving your goals. I loved all of the lectures but the lectures that dealt with HTML, or android app were little fuzzy, because sometimes I wondered what this particular line in the code means (I know sometimes we need to look just for the template to understand the big picture). So the instructor can improve in those sections! Thank you so much!!! I am a happy ex-student of this course!!"

As an experienced programmer I am learning interesting things such as which libraries to use, how to configure and extend the environment, and so on -- all good.  As an experienced programmer, I am now finding that many of the examples demonstrate the worst of programming practices -- almost no suggestions about reuse, abstraction, or any of the other best practices used by professional developers.  I guess my comment would be that all of this is fine, as an exercise in learning.  What's missing is the acknowledgement that these quick-and-dirty approaches are wrong in almost every way in any professional development context.  To say another way, it seems as though Ardit is not clear about what makes for good or proper programming versus how he does his normal day-to-day programming.  It would be far better to prime the developer with ideas about best-practices as they go, rather than explaining alternatives later."

It would be nice to have pause moments in key places where teacher would ""wait"" for students to copy the code and to highlight the new code.

Also the teacher is not explaining why he adds this or that code. Just murmuring sth like everybody knows what is happening. E.g. index=list2.curselection() - when they add [0] without explaining. And there are more such small moments when i just copy the code and don't understand why..

+ when the teacher is explaining, he refers to the pieces of the code as ""this"" and ""that"", and it's hard to identify what exactly he is referring to. especially when he is explaining fast.."

It's a bit irritating that in the quiz section they'll have you use methods that weren't outlined in the videos, and also that they don't have more practice quizzes after each section.  I'm finding it hard to really commit things to memory without a little bit more immediate concerted practice.  It seems to go through too many lessons without drilling you on things so that you'll actually remember them."

I liked how the first few practical lessons teach you working with only one library (geocoding, flask, pandas, bokeh etc.) only to slowly combine more and more of them in the next lessons, until the final ones, where all of them are combined and used together. This really helps you solidify and exercise your skills. 

Other than that, the course was well made, understandable (I had some prior programming background, but was never bored with the basics) and overall very useful. Thank you, Ardit."

Ardit provides little exercises that let those studying python practice components (focused capabilities) of what they're learning. There are some practice courses or full python courses where you build a few full applications and while those are good (Ardit has a course like that), they don't provide enough practice. The exercises here focus on specific areas (usually a few at a time) and help novice python programmers practice and reinforce their learning so they internalize it. 

Ardit, please make another class like this that focuses exclusively on more intermediate and advanced content."

This is a fundamental block that I have been missing which led me to believe that coding was all about having a good memory which is not true. If you know how to find the code that you want to use, it is not so much about memory but more about practicing the methods to acquire what you need."

The Python Excercises: From Beginner to Expert,2019-11-23 08:22:55+00:00,5.0,Really enjoy the challenges.  The challenges get gradually harder as section progresses - and I find this particularly good learning as we are required to really think hard about small sections i.e. the nuts and bolts.  After each section Ardit provides a summary of the challenges in video that we can walk through what we have done and he then explains in short video clips certain aspects that we need to consider for the next section.  Ardit is one of my favourite instructors and I really enjoy his teaching style.  I will update as I progress.

I would enjoy some more visual explanations for some of the theory to know why we are doing something and how it will contribute to a larger project."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2019-10-17 21:03:33+00:00,4.5,"Definitely learned a lot in this course. I took it knowing the best way to learn is by doing, and we definitely did a lot of that. So that alone is worth a great rating.

There were a fair amount of areas where the instructor explained the what, but didn't explain the why. As someone curious about the way the system works, I found that to be the most frustrating part of the course. Appreciate that you don't want to make 3hr long lectures, but lot of code that may seem basic to most advanced coders was just implemented without a whole lot of explanation.

Finally, this is more of a udemy thing, but a course like this desperately needs a FAQ section organized by lecture. I was tearing my hair out on certain sections thinking I had written everything perfectly, only to realize that there were real-world impediments (like the cache in my browser) that was screwing it up. I know that part of the learning process of coding is searching for solutions on the internet, but given that its a beginners course, some of the more common problems should be addressed. 

Overall, really liked the experience. A lot to absorb all at once, but will be coming back to review."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2019-10-04 07:43:42+00:00,1.5,"The coarse is awful and poor and that is because:
1- the because the instructor way of explanation is so bad
2- even if you try to contact the instructor he would not replay
3-the 10 apps you will be building will be using python library in which he did not explain so you will be COPY/PAST the code most of the time without understanding it
4- some of the code will not work even if you PAST it, thus you need to google the solution
MY SUGGESTION: rather than making 10 apps that you do not explain well, make 5 apps and explain every thing about it

My aim was to learn Python, with the Python Megacourse, and I personally found too much focus on certain very useful libraries, rather than core language and building up that experience more than quickly delving into complex utility libraries. A very good course, well put together, but for me, a little over the top versus what I was looking and hoping for. Still useful non the less."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2019-09-20 16:45:35+00:00,4.0,"Technical: 
Video quality ---- 10/10, his video editing skill is gold! 
Volume quality ---- 6/10, sorry but some of the videos have higher volume, some lower, sometimes during one video he lower his voice then a lot louder, almost make me jump off my chair! 

Content: (Won't go Pro/Con style because the pros/cons are mixed depend on who's reading) 
If you're a complete beginner, I mean like you don't know anything about programming, this might be overwhelming, BUT, if you can power through, you might save yourself a lot, I mean, a lot of time on the programming/app making/whatever path you choose

If you're like me: check out some of the beginner's course, know basic programming but have no idea what to do next. ""Advanced"" course are too advanced, beginner's course repeat the same thing. This course is perfect for you! 

I think you should take the course because this course fixes 1 of the biggest challenge that almost every ""self learners"" face: They don't have enough material to go further than the basic skill of making dummy, classroom type ""apps"" 
This course teaches you a lot of topics, a lot of useful knowledge. You can choose one or a few apps to go further. 

The limitation of this course that could potentially be the advantage: 

Because he teaches you how to make a real world app, there are a lot of gaps you need to fill out for yourself! 
Lots of things are only mentioned briefly. So the limitations of the course is that: you might get overwhelmed because of some of the technologies you've never heard of. But if you think about it, it's not the limitations of the course. Nowadays everybody has to be self taught, he gives you a guidance, you have to research deeper. 
For example, he shows you how to make a website, with server and such. But the information on the website is very poor. So if you want to go into the web development path with python as the back-end language, then take what he shows you, go learn more about html, css, js..... 

The one reason I usually got stuck at is that I don't have a map or a simple guidance of what to do. For example, ok I know the basics but then now what? If I want to go build apps, what do I need? What technologies do I do research on? Stackoverflow has millions of people with different opinion and advice, what do I choose? 
So with this course, you get that map! That's definitely priceless compare to the price you pay for the course. 
Most other course would focus on 1 thing. So use this course as the ""table of content"" or the ""study path"" where you learn everything at the surface. And go for other deeper courses on those topics. At least you won't waste your money and time trying out things just to find out there's a better thing out there because on some ""beginner's course"" they show you some low level thing since you're ""beginner"" 


So yes, I recommend taking the course, he speaks very slowly so I usually watch at 1.25, 1.5 speed --- you can finish this course quicker than the stated hours (of course, keep in mind - 1hr of lecture should equal 3-4hrs of self study - college rule lol). 
I think this is a good source of guidance through a lot of path that you want to take. 
Oh, and TA and the instructor are very responsive! 

Definitely check out his other courses."

Lot of practice sessions also give a good practice of each and every topic so that one gets a good hands on. The only issue is few of the videos are a little blurred in the start and mid sections which causes a little error while reading whats there on the screen. Otherwise everything has been very good so far. A Heads Up!!

In some lectures he oly manages to scratch the surfacce of the using some modules and libraries.
Working with postgresql is a huge pain. Installing, running pgAdmin4, setting it up correctly. It needs a lecture on it separately especially if the students use differents OSes."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2019-09-11 14:54:01+00:00,1.0,"The title of this course is missleading, it should be "" Watch me just do and try to learn on your own"" The course is preety amaturely presented, there is no explanation from the teacher who often jumps from one subject to another  without explaining the theory behind the  matterial correctly and in depth, up untill the first project all goes well then he jumps from 0 to 100 so to speak and  just starts typing away commands with zero explanation, impossible to learn like this. Furthermore  there are no exercises!!! When the courses get's into more advanced stuff, he films on the spot while he writes code and you have to pause the video and copy what he does and back and forth, there is no way of learning something like this!!! This gets really boring fast!!! He should first present something simple and then provide exercises for the student to work on his own!! I have to mention the terrible accent and deep draging voice of the teacher that makes it even more boring and difficult to understand the lessons, it's more suitable for a hypnotist but he cannot help it I guess. Try another Course."

Sometimes, the teacher was not fast in answering the questions ( this is the main reason why I m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 ) but I always get the answers on any of my questions. I m recommending this course. Even if you never touched python you will be able to follow this course."

I downloaded python and the ide and took 50 lectures on the first day. Some minor inconsistencies did not pose a big problem, I could follow everything straight away. It would be helpful if it was explained in more detail how to find the functions you need. Dir() and help() are ok but I would not know what to do if I wanted to draw data from an excell list. I know there must be information in the internet but you could show us your methods like useful websites, books etc. At the end you have to be able to solve your own problems, an overview in different areas is definitely helpful but understanding how to get the necessary information is key."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2019-08-22 15:45:17+00:00,3.5,"Decent course. However some of the code and lessons here can be somewhat outdated like the %s formatting method, which can easily be replaced and understood in an easier way with the new f string interpolation method that was introduced in python 3.6, and sometimes the explanations Ardit gives are vague and requires a bit more repetition in order to fully grasp the messages and concepts he's conveying. Other than those two criticisms that I noted, this course is overall decent and is worth a buy especially for the coding exercises and the building of 10 real world applications in this course."

Personally, I fell that some project (from 5 to 9) are excessively narrative, meaning that all technology/library is explained in the making of the project. As such, it feels that we are merely copying code. I think it would be more interesting to have the material as an autonomous lecture and the project as in project 10, i.e., an independent project where the objective is shown and we have to code by our own.

The programs are interesting to elaborate, but it would be interesting to have a lesson on code structure, e.g., how to structure the scripts in the virtual environment, script structure, etc.

Nonetheless, I feel this course is interesting and that it catapults the Python understanding and knowledge of a person from a beginner to an intermediate level."

The Python Excercises: From Beginner to Expert,2019-08-14 22:26:21+00:00,4.5,"This was a good course for me to solidify my knowledge of python basics.  This course is definitely for people who have already taken a course or two on Python and want a bunch of practice exercises to do.  I did not find the video ""explanations"" to be very helpful but I did appreciate that the instructor posted solutions to all of the problems that I could review when I got stuck.  Definitely also need to  be able search for solution hints on stack overflow if you don't want to just look at the instructor solution.  Overall I'm glad I took this course.  I especially appreciated doing some exercises using the glob module and the difflib module that I was not very familiar with.  I would love the instructor to consider a follow-up course with another 100 exercises that explore more modules within the standard library for ""low intermediate"" learners like me to practice on.  Thanks!"

Really appreciated the work of Ardit Sir.
He had done a really well job.
But, i think one more topic you can include is the use of Django framework.It is one of the useful frameworks.Although the topics you covered are awesome.
And yes i will definietely going to use the knowledge you provided me in this journey.
When i will make something using python, i would like to share it with you.
Last thing i want to say is,


Very Very Thank you Sir. you may have put me ahead in life.

Sorry for bad english"

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2019-08-08 16:37:46+00:00,4.5,yes it was amazing but it could have been more better. instead of leaving the practice to us you could have given assignments to submit online with use of all previous taught items. based on which you could have analysed our progress. overall it was a facinating experience.

Just some remarks on my experience: I enjoyed section 6 and 7 not so much, it was very dry. When we were finally able to build the interactive english dictionary i assumed we would play around a bit more with that making ourselves more familiar. Also the tkinter seems to be a very specific thing to learn, (i want to learn more about the webapps), but I assume you do it for us getting more familiair with connecting backend to frontend so later on we can more easily use these concepts on the web. Maybe good to mention why you choose for specific sections, just to bring us along on the journey you have in mind for us, expectation management wise. anyhow overall so far so good!"

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2019-07-19 06:30:11+00:00,5.0,"Yes, great course so far.  Ardit tackles Python in a good way that is different from other tutors as he doesn't start at raw basics like x == y .. he uses real world programs then dissects the program into it's core components line for line.   For me, this is very helpful as I can relate the course content to real world output.  I can see how the programs start, end and how they are put together.  You don't necessarily need to understand everything, but starting with the whole concept and breaking it down is nice.  Ardit's accent is a little unusual at first - but I know English isn't his first language but his English is very good so no problem, just takes a few lectures to understand the phonetics.  So, Ardit uses real-world teaching methods and contextualises the course content so we are working in a more practical way.
Just to update .. Ardit has since updated the course and it is even better!  I'd like to mention that for me, if I play Ardit talking at 1.5x this is perfect.  In fact it makes his short lectures so much on point it really is probably the best lecture type course I am currently busy with.  I'm doing many Python courses just now and Ardit is one of my top 3 lecturers.  Again, because the course is broken down into short manageable videos that are action specific and there are many short practice tasks/quizzes/exercises that are key.  So many courses get the questions too complicated and end up making the student frustrated.  Ardit avoids this and his course is perfect watched at 1.5 x speed.  Awesome stuff!

I'd also like to add, I find his explanations and development of both front end and back end simple and clear.  What I really enjoy is how Ardit stays on point with his teaching direction.  We don't jump from topic to topic endlessly and needlessly.  We walk through the programs from start until completion and I'm learning so much about all the stages of development I'm thoroughly enjoying his presentation.  Can't wait for Ardits next course so I can finish that too.  Thank you Ardit, great man!"

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2019-07-16 10:21:35+00:00,1.5,"The teacher in the course has a very thorough step by step approach to coding. The big problem however is he tells you ""how to"" not ""why it is"". A great example of this is when he is teaching about how to look up problems at stack overflow. There are 2 answers one is downvoted where the ""teacher"" is questioning why it is down voted, because the answer is correct. The answer is basically ""this doesn't work"" providing no solution to how to get it to work or explains why it doesn't work. I feel the course has many of the same problems throughout. It is a ton of ""this is how it is"" teaching not why and how."

The Python Excercises: From Beginner to Expert,2019-07-14 08:42:52+00:00,3.0,"Idee ist prima, denn nur durch eigenes Coden lernt man es. - Die Umsetzung ist aber noch ziemlich holprig, der Udemy Server gibt Fehler an, die im lokalen Interpreter als korrekt durchgehen (zu kleinlich) und es werden oft wenig hilfreiche Fehlermeldungen gemacht (""Wrong code, try again""). Das ist frustrierend und hat dazu geführt, daß ich den Autor mit vielen Fragen gleichen Inhalts, warum meine Antwort denn falsch sei, überhäufen mußte. Er antwortete immer prompt und hilfreich.
Vorschlag für hilfreichere Fehlermeldungen: 
- Originaltext der Fehlermeldung ausgeben, ggf. für Ungeübte erklären (z.B. ""Fehler kann auch in der Zeile darüber liegen""), kryptische Texte vereinfachen (s. https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html , Concrete Exceptions )
- Allgemeiner Code-Check wie:   ""Schreibfehler?"", ""wie ändert sich der Wert beim beim 1. /2./3. ... Schleifendurchlauf?"", ""Stimmt der Datentyp"", ""Zwischenwerte mit print() erhalten"", ""Datentyp mit type() ermitteln"" ...
- Spezieller Code-Check: Einblenden von ""Hints"" bei Fehlversuchen, User-defined Exceptions"

The interaction was really well done. The course was very helpful since I am training myself for a second career. I am currently an electrical engineer for an architectural / engineering firm and am looking forward to something new. The only real complaint was Udemy changing the interface to the web site. When I started the course I could have Atom and the browser window opened on a MacBook with enough spacing to see clearly. With the new web site it's almost impossible to you are constantly flipping from the lecture to Atom to another web page to test to a terminal etc.
Otherwise a great course that I'm sure I will refer back to."

Basics were easy but with some extra information that not mentioned in Python books about working with ""datetime"" types. A Web Application small project brings more logic for other web applications for different frames as Django. The application for using map-coordinates has an inspiration for exploring maps data. I think than more you learn than more interesting."

I also found that many of the error messages do not correlate to the code used and using the error to decipher was wrong seemed impossible in a few cases. Seemed like the error was for a totally different question.

My one issue is more of a platform thing, but in order to complete the course and get the certificate I seem to have to watch all of the videos. However, there is a test at the start which more or less advises me to skip the first bit as it covers python basics that I do not feel for re-doing. Would be great if there is a way to tick that as viewed.

Would totally recommend."

The Python Course: From Beginner to Expert,2019-06-21 09:21:26+00:00,4.5,"Very good course for beginners, but also those who already know something will find interesting facts about which they had no idea.
A very good idea with exercises to be recreated by yourself. Although my solutions differed from yours, they gave the same result. As you wrote under one of the comments, if the result is correct, it means that everything is OK.
It's great that you showed examples of applications that do something ""real"", which is why I'm going to your next course.
At the end, I missed a bit that you did everything in Windows, and you did not show examples in iOS or Linux, but let's say that the problems I encountered and their solution were just an extra learning.
Thank you very much Adrit!"

Como una introducción podría valer. No obstante para alguien que NO sepa nada de programación es claramente insuficiente.

Porque ele ensina a praticar, ele realmente mostra utilidade da programação. Esse foi praticamente o primeiro curso de programação que fiz. Faz um ano que estudo de entusiasta e não encontrei um curso que chegasse perto desse. Outros cursos ficam mostrando partes técnicas da linguagem que não servem para nada considerando o usuário médio, só um gênio iria conseguir sair de conceitos básicos para construir aplicações reais. Esse curso parte de aplicações reais para ensinar Python. Todos os cursos deveriam ser assim. Parabéns ao autor."

I did struggle a bit with the ""input"" function as didn't realise I was running python v2 when in the ""PythonAnywhere"" console - so it errors when it tries to evaluate the result of input.   So had to run the code with ""python3 basics.py""   Maybe I'm silly but this took me ages to work out as I thought I had a error in my code.  ""python basics.py""  gives a frustrating error like ""NameError: Name 'Apple'  is not defined"" ."

The Python Excercises:Data Processing by use of Python,2019-05-29 10:35:44+00:00,4.0,"1. The video quality was changing through out each lecture.  For some time it used to be clear, then it used to become blurr, then after some time clear again and so on.
2. We also need to have some notes at the end of each lecture else it is easy to forget what was taught in the lecture.  Also, if we need to refer to the content later on, we should not require to open the video and go through it again.  Notes are much quicker for revision."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2019-05-28 00:39:42+00:00,5.0,This guy is an awesome human being. He has spent so much time on this course and it shows. I have used a python udemy boot camp that was $20 more and had less information than this course. If you are even thinking about buying this course do it. It's worth it!

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2019-05-27 23:42:46+00:00,4.5,"Some info was taught very slow and repetitive. Maybe is my opinion because I know other languages and all of them superficially share the same (functions, loops, etc) with their own sintaxis.
For example section 23 is the same as section 21 and 22 with the explanation of connecting backend and frontend. The app could be done through both sections.
Section 28 and 29 could be merged.
Section 31, 2hr 47min, very very slow videos, changing things and going to console every change, etc.  Like db.session.add(email, height), try, then data = Data(email, height) and db.session.add(data), there are a lot of situations like that in many videos making them slow.
But is a great course!! I learned a lot about interesting tools like pandas, tkinter, flask and bokeh.
Thank you Ardit.

The Python Excercises:Data Processing by use of Python,2019-05-14 20:31:25+00:00,3.0,"I picked up this course as part of an upcoming role transition to a metadata processing position. Though I appreciated the coverage on pandas, there were several unedited typos and filename mismatches in the videos that made the learning experience a hit-and-miss (e.g. -99999 instead of -9999 in the weather station data set). In addition, recent updates to the libraries taught in the course have invalidated some of the code (e.g. seaborn.plt no longer valid).

I started as a web/game developer and have some prior Python experience from an introductory university course, so I was able to work around the niggles and figure things out myself on the most part. But for others needing a more gradual and comprehensive coverage of basics (e.g. control structures, basic execution flows, etc.), this course probably wouldn't work as well and would just lead to copy-and-paste dependency."

That because the teacher, although very patiently answering every question and giving very short, slow-paced lectures, still fails to explain throughoutly the logic behind the language. I can't help but to feel confused about the order of arguments and functions or about which way to choose when solving a problem. I'll keep taking the classes but to be very honest as a begginner I kind of regret buying the more ""straightfoward"" looking course instead of looking for a more didactical one. I hope I come back later to say I've changed my mind."

I am doing a degree in computer science and started out with Python in the first semester, but I wanted to refresh what I had learned as I hadn't had a chance to use it much in several months. Even though I mostly understood the program at the beginning I still started with the basics, it was a good reminder of some things and more importantly helped me really understand some things I didn't quite graps the first time learning python. Understanding error messages was definitely better explained here than what I initially taught, or at least what I remembered. 
I'm really looking forward to the projects which will let me experience even more of what Python can do. I highly recommend this course. Even if you already know a little bit of Python, if you're not fully confident in the basics or need a brush up this course will get you up to speed really quickly."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2019-04-29 12:24:52+00:00,5.0,"Yes, this is a good match for me.  I like the way in which you step through what you are doing and clearly outlining the course work ahead.  I feel more confident after having only seen the intro thus far, that I will have a good working knowledge of python at the end of this course.  Looking forwarding to creating some programs!!
I really appreciate the updates that were made to the course.  The additional course work was extremely helpful. Now that I am getting into the real world application of this course, I greatly appreciate the effort it takes to create a website from scratch and connecting it to a database. Having used an application that contained ""canned"" website templates,  this course has encouraged me to pursue building my very own website from scratch.  Thank you!"

The libraries that Ardit uses helps this course stand out from the others (who wants to waste their time building a simple calculator when Ardit's course has you go straight into things like web-cam motion detection, stock analysis and web scraping). Some things in this course require a certain level of problem solving programmer intuition, so I would easily recommend to anyone with a fair amount of programming exposure. Cheers!"

Ardit's delivery is a bit mumbly, but it is still easy to understand. I was happy I'd already done another course that explained the theory behind Python, Ardit isn't always great at explaining things (OOP for example), but he is really good at showing you how you can use these things in practice. There were some details in the course where outdated code hadn't been flagged, but overall I found it to be a really useful and fun course for a beginner like myself."

Would love a little more dive into the Classes used such as DataFrame etc to get a better understanding of the shape of it and how it is expected to be used, but am still understanding and learning.
On another note, I know it's 3 years too late, but following PEP8 in the code would have been great."

Covers a lot of different topics and actually gives you the background enough to start writing applications by yourself. I like also the parts with real-time troubleshooting, since it shows how it looks in reality. Also I liked the exercises in the earlier parts of the course. One thing that could be improved is to introduce similar exercises but more difficult ones in the later parts of the course.
Thanks!"

Each section was broken down in a clear enough fashion to allow for comments to be made throughout each script. Most notable was the instructors way of leading viewers with each application, offering a means of self-verification as the applications were built. If I had to offer one recommendation for the course, it would be to include a bit more detail on certain topics, such as CSS and html, within the course. Otherwise, this is an excellent course for those looking to get started with Python application development, but aren't sure how."

I wanted a good course with a lot of examples  in many topics , 
and then I found this course , 
the most thing I like it about this course is being realistic , 
it helps narrowing the gap between studying and real life applications , it was really a great experience , 
thanks a lot for this course , you are a great instructor  
------
you will learn a lot if you are a complete beginner , 
but I highly recommend it for those who learnt programming but didn't make something real  , those who feel that they can't do any thing for real or work in this industry like me ,
I couldn't believe that I can work as a developer ""however I want to have career"" but this course made me feel that I have a good enough chance to be a good programmer developer it boosted my confidence !  and it's really a must to learn programming in this era of technology ! , 
Thanks a lot <3 ..."

One little thing I wish Mr. Sulce can improve on was the little typos from time to time in the lecture. While they serve good purpose on showing how most programming bugs come from, can still be a bit distracting and time-wasting.
Maybe introduce a lecture in linter?
Overall, a great class."

I'm a software dev and have a pretty good understanding of programming languages just felt like learning some python. That being said, the intro sections would be confusing for any  beginner with no real base in programming as he is focused on command line syntax as compared or setting up a VM for python rather than  to explaining ""what python is"" and how it works.  Its a good way to scare beginners off right away.

Moving forward the lectures are extremely scattered with little explanation or utility (ex spending full lectures on nothing of any importance). A lot of the complaints in here are about the use of libraries.I get it python is a library based system, but the instructor spends so much time on these libraries he doesn't bother to explain the simple parts of python. If I wanted a course on libraries I'd just go to the docs page and read about a library.

Overall if I could I would give it 0/5 but 1/5 is the lowest it can go."

The name showing that you will get most of the python, but until now, about 40% of course, I'm still in basics that can be given in 1 hour of time MAXIMUM with examples!

There is nothing until now for the structure of the project, best practice of the structure, how to create your own library and modules and how to use them, from titles coming, I don't see anything promising.

My Review subject to change later, until now, 40%, totally waste of time."

I found this Cisco Networks Postbaccalaureate Certificate.  This course so far provides me solid footing to begin and make the journey.  This Cisco Unified Communication Manager is creating a single app for calling, messaging, meetings, and Team Collaboration. Can you assist with my directions of this desired goal?

I don't seem to find in realness in this.  I ask questions.  I know that no one reads them, nor can I find an acceptable answer on the frequently asked questions, so I mosey along.  Unacceptable

Ardit Sulce please read and respond:
I worked more five (5) hours today, and still don't have Python Anaconda installed.
I google as per your instructions in the class; however results doesn't show Python Anaconda the way it is on the class site.  If I go to the site https://www.python.org/downloads/, the site has Alternatives, but doesn't show what you instruct the student to do.

https://www.continuum.io/downloads 

I did find Anaconda Installer archive includes the one download (Anaconda3-2.3.0-Windowsx86_64.exe) that you show in the class.. Should I install this one from the Anaconda Installer Archive?  I cannot find this any place else of the places that you instructed in for me to go to.
Please answer soon, so that I can gain usage of this programming language.  Right now, I am very dissatisfied with the progress.  I so very much want to utilize this program language.

The way he is using command line prompt is bonus for people who are new to programming to learn command line prompt along with python.  Examples that are provided are good.  I like the Ardit's pace and the length of each lecture being short, which is allowing to follow along and try it."

The progression of difficulty was ideal, and the applications were interesting and potentially useful in many ways if developed further. Presentation was good. 

Several additions to the videos had been made (as of 3/19) to keep the matter up-to-date, despite 3rd party changes to many a package and API. Some other courses are not so kind or efficient as to do this, but here the effort was made, which was really great - very encouraging for the student! The support in Q&A was very helpful. There were plenty of hints on further topics to look up. 

Perhaps some more diagrams describing process or layout would be good during longer or more complicated topics (eg 20-224, introducing Bokeh with Flask, had a lot of talking but no explanatory diagrams meantime, whereas a very helpful diagram was shown throughout section 13 on TKinter layout). 

Overall an excellent course - useful Python matter, very well explained.

Much obliged."

1. The instructor keeps repeating very obvious things, giving me the impression that he doesn't have in mind what he was about to say. He also comes back and forth a lot when explaining the code so it feels disorganized.

2. The bad smell of his code. Just look at the final code of app 1, why repeating the ""get_close_matches()"" several times when you can wrap it up in a variable or function? As a programmer myself, I simply can't stand poor code like this.

3. The instructor's accent. It's even more irritating for me given that he keeps talking about unimportant things.

Things I like about this course (the only thing that still keeps me learning despite all things I don't like):

1. It successfully shows the broadness of what Python can do."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2019-02-19 09:55:23+00:00,3.0,"It started out nice and slow where I could follow along with ease, but all of a sudden I was expected do programming i barely understood and It was going from simple 1-5 unnested lines of code to all new never seen before ""myfile.dosomething().dosomethingelse()"" 5-10 lines nested within each other in if-for and while loops. and when i looked at the solution, I could clearly see that I would never have solved it on my own.

This is not very motivational way of learning and I have paused this curse in searched of other curses who does a more slow pace.

It would be much better to take a big clean advanced code, that could be broken down and then show and make us do the basics first then after a while take the same code and copy it in a loop and so on till the big code was finally written. Actually like Ardit did in the beginning of this curse. Instead he abandon this system rather quickly after the first example and jumps around with installing packages and thinks we can program (for me rather complicated stuff) after 50 lessons."

Note at times we face errors but for which you need to google and find the answers.

One small suggestion for the author is while he says pls reach out for any help I did not get a response and would appreciate if he could respond.

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2019-02-15 05:43:08+00:00,5.0,"I finished this course and this is my review.
I skipped (more like fast running) through all the basis because I am not a beginner to Python.  It took me more than a month to finish this.
My opinion: this course is perfect for someone who's just learned basis and want to make further use with Python.
This course teaches real applications such as web apps, web crawling, even automatic emailing,... which are really mainstream useful in real-life.
About the number ""10"", actually I would call them ""skills"" more than ""applications"" because they are small-scaled and probably a small function of a real-life application.
My tips when you consider buying this course:
1. Learn ahead Python as much as possible.
2. Get used to finding solutions on google.
3. turn speed of video to 1.5x if you feel frustrated by slow-speaker like me, :p  The teacher is German (as I guess) and he has some small accent (words like ""hour"" or ""Linux"") in it but wholly speaking his communication is more than fine. 
4. He has a really nice and active assistant and a lot of helpful learners in the course, so, take advantage of the Q&A even when you pass the lesson, still read a bit and see some worth-reading comments. This section is not only for asking, but sharing as well."

The best in Ardit's courses is that you will always get new libraries, new ways to solve things. This course is not ""fast"". The description may fool you. You will have to search the internet to solve a few exercises, learn and re-learn new practices. 

This is a course that a beginner can take. But it will be more valued as a course to remember and revision the things you learnt in other Ardit's courses."

I have also done some C++ Exploring but haven't been able to do much with it. Mostly my issues were the IDE and how to debug a'm starting this class as a beginner because there were a few lines of the code I didn't know. The if statements were very easy for me. I still occasionally write psudo code.

I studied Python for a year in postgraduate studies --> OOP problem.
I bought a great book to learn Python --> OOP problem.
Tried to read online courses --> OOP problem.
Got this course --> eureka! It was really that simple?

Thank you Ardit, you were the only person that helped me to understand it (as you said - no dogs, cats, and other animals - let's try to write real application to see how OOP works - that was enough for me). After I finished your course I'm now able to rewrite any of my old app to OOP. I don't even write my new applications without using OOP anymore.

As of the rest of the course... it's huge. Author shows the basic parts of many python libraries. As I'm watching present job offers these libriaries are commonly required. And you as a student just learned their basics! What else do you need?"

Great job - and I am keen to enroll in some of the other courses that he offers as well.

The Python Course: 100 Excercises for Beginners,2018-12-27 23:38:25+00:00,4.5,"This is a great course for students that want to practice and improve their python skills. The exercises start simple and slowly progress in complexity throughout the course. Now that I've finished the course I feel quite confident in my ability to quickly write quality python code for a wide variety of purposes. It's great to be able to compare your code to that of the instructor. Often this reveals an alternate solution or a more efficient way to organize your program.

My only complaint is that some of the exercises early on are a bit too simple. I very much enjoyed the challenging exercises at the end of the course and would have liked to see a few more like that.

Overall a great buy and I highly recommend the course."

Thank your for this course!"

The first section explains how to set up an environment on a virtual server with an online provider, without any explanation why. 

The instructor does not even bother to go to the official Python website; how to download and install Python on your computer, how it is stored on your computer or which programs that can used to run it on your computer. 

So, if you want to gain knowledge of simple things like how Python works and how to use it on your own computer, you need to head over to youtube for some real beginner videos, and while there, you might as well just stay there. 

Let's say you want to do some coding somewhere with no internet connection, then bad luck!

It should also be disclosed that Windows users has NO business in this course. 

On a positive note, the instructor seems very knowledgeable and uses a nice tone of voice. 


Because you will be lost already from the very beginning, I can only give 1 star and not recommend this course to beginners who really want to understand how this works."

Ardit has a solid knowledge of this kind of data analysis. And even you maybe not entirely interested in GIS, this course was the best. Short, direct to the point and it served me as an aweasome training on creating functions, an inexpected bonus for me.

The only down thing is that you have to download a lot of things, my internet is not very good and the course could use a revamp to clean some parts, update few lines of code and reorganize the lessons a little better. There was too much ""file searching"" and since I was using Linux and I was used to use Linux file system and Jupyter notebook, I had to adapt some parts to work. Nothing major and, again, a nice bonus to practice this kind of operations with OS modules, input and output files."

Ardit, the tutor has a lot of empathy for the student and the way the topics are fully covered makes it a very enjoyable learning experience.

All software installation that was required and project progression went perfectly as described, including ones that had been updated since the lesson were recorded are clearly noted and described where necessary.

I found Ardit to be very knowledgeable and thorough with the lessons.

I would highly recommend this course to others.

I have finally downloaded anaconda and have spyder completed further then come upagainst another problem. I cannot download the pip install simplekml from the commandline. This meant I could not finish the course properly as the next lectures were mostly based on the kml.
I am fairly fine with most things. You teaching is well above average but the technical support is limiting and frustrating. I know that is nothing to do with your actual teaching but it plays a big part in time issues. Maybe a technical section where you say 'if you have a problem with this, this may be the answer', I find the Q and A section more limiting."

Ardit's course is fast-paced with easy-to-comprehend logic and theory as well as real-world applications that can easily be expanded to pad a beginner's portfolio. I'm looking forward to doing just that when I'm done with my certification course in January. I'm taking this course in preparation for that. There is so much you can do with python. One wonders what they need any other programming language for."

My only constructive criticism is that there is no section on developing structured, commented code for professional settings.

Thank you very much for your wonderful course, as a beginner, I really enjoy it and would like to give you some feedbacks:
Pros:
1. Very clear and concise. What I really like is that you showed us some error and taught us how to solve these error step by step, which is very important.
2. I really like the Q&A forum, there is always someone helped to solve my problem quickly.
3. The updating. Thank you for updating the content and tell us the place/version we need to change.

Cons:
If possible, I would like you to tell us the difference between OS. For example, when installing the virtual environment, we Mac users have pain without your guidance.

Oh, if possible, I would also want to know how to use documentation of a language, for example, some library, method, I think I need a more detailed explanation about how to use it.

Thank you anyway!
Have a good day always!"

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-11-12 21:31:17+00:00,5.0,"I was not a complete beginner, let's say an ""almost beginner"" when I started the course, but I still felt that I learned a lot even by watching and practicing from the very first lecture. By the end, thanks to the great explanations of Ardit, I feel I understood everything and that a new world opened up for me using Python. 
Before even finishing the course I was able to build my own working Korean-Hungarian dictionary app with graphical interface, which uses my excel word list as resource, so I'm quite satisfied.
I'd also like to mention a small but rather important thing about Ardit's teaching and videos: He makes mistakes, like simple typos - A lot :) But instead of cutting them out he left them in the videos so now I think I'm also more convenient handling syntax errors thanks to the fact I watched him correcting himself many many times.
Big Thanks, Ardit! I'll be looking forward to your next courses."

This is very good course to get started with Python and many might find applications usefully starting point for future projects. 

Personally I didn't like that Jupyter was used in so many cases in this course but that's just my opinion. Also you should name you python files with some other way than script1, app1 or mysite as you are teaching programming and naming should't probably be done in that way. 

Anyway,  very good useful course if you are fairly new to python and still learning syntax and capabilities of python."

I think it does a reasonable job in this respect with some of the medium/experienced exercises. Their difficulty/complexity level matched the ones that I got for live coding sessions over the phone in some interviews. Mind you, nothing to do with what to expect in a 'real' (on-site) coding interview, these screenings are meant to test basic coding knowledge and are usually done over the phone, with a live coding website, and take no more than 10 minutes.

The easy exercises, are a bit too simple in this respect, but they serve as a nice gentle introduction.

All in all a positive experience."

The course went on hold for several months while occupied with real world python programming.

I recently took up where I left of and found that my weak points had bettered.

I finished the course - the last 55 lectures within 2 days.

I like the challenge the instructor presents and though we have very different styles we get the same results.

I can recommend anyone to take up the challenge."

Ist es sein ermüdender Vortragungsstil oder sein Akzent bzw. hat es den Eindruck als hätte er eine Art Sprachfehler. 

Finde es auch nicht gut, dass er alles in der Kommandozeile macht. Was ich gut finde sind die Quizzes und Übungsbeispiele, weil diese wirklich zum Nachdenken anregen.

Für meinen Geschmack wurde in den Kurs viel zu viel reingepackt, damit man letztendlich das Etikett ""Mega"" anhängen kann. Das ist kontraproduktiv, weil letztlich ohnehin alles nur an der Oberfläche kratzt. Mich interessiert Web Scraping, das kommt im Kurs vor, aber ich weiß jetzt schon, dass es nicht so hilfreich sein wird. Stattdessen werde ich mir wohl einen anderen Kurs, der sich rein damit beschäftigt, kaufen.

Ich möchte dem Autor auch empfehlen sich ein Script zurecht zu legen, nach dem die Punkte abgearbeitet werden. Bei manchen Lektionen wird gelabert und gelabert, es zieht sich unnötig in die Länge. Komm auf den Punkt! Eigentlich schade. Für einen Einstieg reicht es, eher viel zu lang. Wie gesagt, bin erst bei der Hälfte und es ist wirklich mühsam. Werde wohl den Großteil nur punktuell ansehen und skippen."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-10-27 01:06:59+00:00,5.0,"I would like to say thank you to Ardit Sulce . It is great for someone would like to know more what is Python can do. My career part is a programmer too, but in the other language. I already know a little of Python, however, I use it for small tasks of my job. I also search on the Internet what can we do with Python but it is too much, where I start with it. And, this course is introduce the real thing we can go with Python, it is perfect. Just small thing I suggest to instructor, that is you should insert the link to official python library, such as OpenCV, so we can find more detail of library can do and function.
Thank you"

Not just because he is teaching us by building real-world applications but also because his teaching skills are phenomenal."

Update : I'd say that at least Ardits answers questions asked from students (not all of them) but he tries i think as there's a lot of students asking. However you should know that if you want to take this course, it's you learning, but then you should try to explore by yourself in order to build the app you want, search for libraries and tools that help you to build something real. 
You know the syntax you know different tools after the course, but it won't make you build something great if you do not really invest a lot of time apart from the course."

What's different for me in taking this Python class is that the instructor gets immediately into a program that contains multiple topics i.e. dict, lists, functions, conditionals. You see all of these topics discussed together as opposed to other classes that deals with each of these topics individually and only puts them together later on...after you have forgotten. I'm really enjoying the class and the instructor's approach."

The Python Course: From Beginner to Expert,2018-10-04 13:02:47+00:00,5.0,"Excellent introductory course -- not too long, not too short, and interesting enough to actually do all the exercises along the way without losing interest as I've done with some Udemy courses. I learned to program decades ago and haven't used those skills much since then; this course has been an excellent way to jump right in with Python, though I admit it might be more appropriate for those with previous programming knowledge, rather than for absolute beginners. I've been working my way through the Learn Python3 The Hard Way textbook, but now I wish I'd watched these lectures first. I will definitely be joining the Python Mega Course by this instructor next."

I'm happy to solve them (except flask-related exercises, I'm not interested in them right now), I've learned a lot. Thanks."
The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-10-04 11:16:50+00:00,4.5,"Python is my first programming language (except VB), and I was afraid. Ardit made it easy and understandable and now I am ready to try, if I cannot, with google and stackoverflow , and I am not so much afraid of CMD line and making errors. 
This package what he is showing is huge and I don't need them all. I'm interested in data analysis and webscraping and sql, not as much in flask. But this is all useful, and it was money well spent :) 
I don't know why someone complains about the accent, try a Vietnamese...or an American.. :)

I found the content very useful and I'm happy to have taken this course. I will use the content hopefully during work. 
Ardit has a nice manner and a pretty understandable accent compared to e.g. an US instructor (eg. I learned from Nick Parlante, and his accent is very heavy for me).
One thing: more practice would be great.

You can always go back to the scripts and check how did you do this and that. Really good content which demystified many topics for me. 

Ardit (the instructor) is absolutely great. He takes time with explaining things, doesn't repeat himself and even go through the sometimes tricky installation process (along with leaving text note how to do it). The best part is that he still actively participates in the forum, answers and comments on  questions submited by participants.

Few among many best points:
1. The course is very resourceful.
2. The trainer is well aware of technology,very knowledgeable. The explanation of subjects is very cool. 
3. The course has a very steady space.
4. Among all I find stock analysis project (with flask/bokeh) has been excellent.

Expectations:
1. The code need to be revised time to time as those gone out-dated/deprecated
2. Some projects are similar, seem to be  interlinked, expecting to be independent of each other."

The hints where very useful and with the help of them I googled a lot and learned many new things about Python and its libraries.
I learned also many important to me libraries that include csv handling, database handling, gui (both windows and web interface) and finally got a glimpse of Flask which helped me feel more relaxed with my struggles with Django.
With my previous small experience on Python and better on other languages, I managed to get through all the exercises only with the hints and now I feel much more confident.
Generally it was money well spend for me."

Each section is roughly the same length, which kept me motivated. (Another course had 1 section which lasted 18 hours, and other courses lasting 1 hour). This course is great because each section is short and sweet too.

I wish there were more exercises to be done separately, as that challenges me and lets me improve. There is only 1 challenge right at the end.

Thanks Ardit"

Especially I appreciate the proper pedagogic approach in the way how authors gradually introduce more and more complex concepts to us. As the person with SW development background I, naturally, try more complex and complicated approaches, (and it requires some research) but presented materials give enough information for start. One small remark - it will be VERY useful to make special emphasis on a style. Good code is not only working code but what is more important - it has to be a READABLE one firsthand! Because programmers spend more time on reading code than on writing it. 
And the more complex code will be the more readable it has to be, otherwise it will be just discarded and replaced. Or misused."

Getting really good at coding is a long and hard battle, no matter how smart you are. A possible solution?

As with so many skills, the most effective teachers are time and repetition.  

Best selling author Anders Ericsson, PhD, Professor for Psychology calls this “deliberate practice”.

Good luck!"

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-09-17 05:57:38+00:00,5.0,"Very glad that I took the dive into this course.  I had tried to start my Python journey with the 'dry concepts' such as syntax and writing code that does not do anything but to prove concepts - This proved to be too boring and unsustainable. 
This course however, really kept me interested. Ardit is a genius - other than for the excitment of building practical applications for the student, he uses these applications to strategically cover the concepts in both Python and the key libraries that we will likely use in the future. 
I would recommend beginners like myself to start here, and then continue self-studying by looking up the details in each concept for a more in-depth understanding.

The course content is very educational, relevant, clearly-explained and well-maintained. Libraries and functions are continually reviewed and followed up by Ardit to ensure that students have a frictionless experience in using them. Minus the things that are out of his control, the effort here by him is very impressive. The amount of detail and explanations for the concepts are well-balanced. 
One minor thing I would recommend as improvement: A printable summary of key concepts with codes after each section for easy reference and revision. I find myself heavily commenting my code in fear that I would forget what I have learnt - not sure if I am supposed to memorise them or if this is the right way to learn.

Long story short: To anyone who is reading this; have no doubt. This is the course to take. Highly recommended."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-09-14 16:47:53+00:00,5.0,Thank you
The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-09-14 16:26:33+00:00,4.5,This is an excellent course in Python that is exactly tailored to my needs. We need Python to operate electronic instruments which includes a camera vision and data processing. I also appreciate that OOP is presented as that is the way reusable code should be created. The real world examples really help to accelerate my Python projects. I would highly recommend this course to my colleagues.

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-09-14 15:36:22+00:00,5.0,"I came into this course with a fair knowledge of Python, all self taught, and was looking to increase my knowledge overall and specifically learn more about areas such as GUI applications, working with databases, and web front end/back end development with Python.  I gained everything I wanted and more.

This course is long, and it covers a lot of material, but if you stick with it, do the exercises, and pay attention you will learn a lot.  I would recommend having a notepad near your computer and making notes.  Everything seems obvious as you're doing it, but in a week, or a month, it won't be anymore.

The course is a couple of years old so Python has been updated, some of the modules and libraries have been updated, etc. so be prepared to actually program, figure a thing or two out, or god forbid actually Google something to get an answer.

In my opinion, having to actually figure out why 1 or 2 little things don't work instead of being spoon fed everything helps and will make you a better programmer in the long run.

Ardit is an excellent instructor.  He explains things well, and instead of just showing working code all of the time he will break the code at critical points and show you the error that you will get if you make a mistake.  As you finish a section of the course and the application you are building he will suggest ways for you to improve it on your own so that you can build on the program and increase your skills and knowledge.

This course isn't perfect, no course is, but this is an excellent resource and learning tool and I highly recommend it."

The Python Course: 100 Excercises for Beginners,2018-09-05 16:49:45+00:00,4.0,Pretty basic so far. I had some issues getting Atom up and running on my Windows 10 machine. Not sure why. It was a straightforward install. It just wouldn't load a terminal window so I could run a python script. Applied the updates and everything started (slowly) working. It also took me longer than I'd like to admit to tell Atom where the Python script files were located. Mostly just my ignorance/stupidness.

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-08-27 04:15:22+00:00,4.5,"This course has been excellent (4.5/5). I knew nothing about python. This course has given me an in-depth understanding of how python syntax works. The instructor is very clear and the overall real world application development is fun. After you finish building one app you get excited for the next one. This shows that the tutors and the structure of the course itself is very well balanced and thought of, to get you going with python programming. 

Only if the course had plenty more brain storming short exercises to fine tune what we learned throughout the course it would be even better - 5/5 probably!!!

I highly recommend it!!!"

It jumped from installing to variables, strings etc. It did not go over establishing a definition for anything. I just followed what was said but some of the errors I encountered and some I've seen questions about were due to certain topics were not discussed in detail. Someone new would not understand you need to def everything not just int and variables. This becomes apparent in the if, else, indentation section. It did not advise you to define ""year"" and some students were getting errors. at the beginning of every new lesson make sure you remind students to define a value. I definitely feel more could have been explained in depth. overall it was good."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-08-22 13:04:04+00:00,4.5,"I enjoyed the course so far (I'm nearly done), the applications are good for real-world and you get a good feeling for developing applications in Python, but there are elements that make this course fall short of 5-star for me:
 - Structure: The course is not structured well enough within the videos, and I often find myself having to drop back into the Dashboard to keep track of where I am. Furthermore the skills you acquire in Python is given by example, and not much guidance is provided on how to find out how to do something in Python for yourself.
 - ""Cheap"": The target market may be people wanting to try everything that's free. But I would have liked more examples or guidance on more 'serious' or professional development of apps. For instance hosting a web app via Azure, or using better GUI tools in Python."

The Python Excercises:Data Processing by use of Python,2018-08-21 06:55:01+00:00,3.0,"Reasonably comprehensive overview, but scattered and inconsistent presentation. Chapters have changed and the course structure doesn't flow nicely. Downloadable files don't match for each video (looking at you chapter 6), which is annoying because I've found my time is much more effectively spent watching the videos then downloading the files - because Ardit gives good explanations, but hammers out code rapidly while continuing to talk. For your non-iPython focused videos (those I follow along with as we do them), I'd much rather download the file afterwards.

Also, Ardit's mic volume is turned too low and, although relatively clear, I find the author to be difficult to engage with when he sighs and draws out his explanations. 

However, for someone entirely new to Python who follows along 100% through all his videos and doesn't expect to rely on downloadable files, I can recommend this as being a good fit. You just may need to pause frequently when Ardit goes from his drawn out (but often helpful) explanations to hammering out 5 lines in 10 seconds without dropping a beat."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-08-16 02:42:32+00:00,3.5,Pretty clear instructions. I enjoy doing things at my own pace.
The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-08-16 00:44:17+00:00,5.0,"As this was my first exposure to Python, I wanted to learn it by coding actual applications, and this course definitely provided that.  This course explored different aspects of what Python can do, and I was very impressed with the real-world applications that were built during the course.

One aspect of the course which I would have liked to have seen more of are the exercises where you work on short Python problems to reinforce and practice what is taught in the lectures.  These were there in the earlier stages of the course, but seemed to dwindle as the course progressed.  

As the instructor has made another course available which focuses on working on 100 Python exercises, I have already signed up to take that course as that is exactly what I'm looking for to improve upon what I've learned from the Python Mega Course, and simply just to practice.

After completing the course, my interest in continuing to learn Python has only increased.  I would recommend this course to anyone looking to get into Python and to be introduced to its versatile capabilities."
The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-08-15 23:37:40+00:00,3.5,I appreciate that explanations are logical (despite easy or difficult). This helps me learn better and easier. It is a reason why I had joined this course so thank you.

However I am completely satisfied with what I have learnt. Sufficient time is given to build the basics / Syntax. Also reference to learning python on Linux was a plus in the course. Sufficient exercises were given, which helped understand the basics. However there is a feeling that the basics and syntax is not complete without understanding how programming is done."

I had learned java before taking this course but could not understand the stucture and flow of the script written with java. After finishing this course, I found it easier to understand the structure of programs in java.

 So the lessons I learned in this course, I can also apply to other languages than python. Due to your course, I am confident i can build my own python applications. 

Thank you for teaching this course."

Ardit explains very well the different subjects (which I wrote as comments line in my different app.py's.

The forum is also very responsive, and to the point.

I enjoyed it a lot, and for a couple weeks, I had a very fine programmer-buddy. 

Well done, Ardit!

For someone who already knows how to program (as is my case)  and is trying to learn Python, the pace is slow most of the time. 

The other problem is that too many libraries are covered before learning the language basic syntax and standard libraries. This makes the course confusing at times. 

Another course by the same author : ""Solve 100 Python Exercises"" was a better option for me."

Forget about what they taught you at your boring class! Programming can also be fun and Ardit takes a different approach by guiding you through coding 10 real World applications! I only saw an ad for this course on Facebook and I thought - what the heck, my manual job sucks and I never gave programming a chance. I decided to buy it and what can I say, I finished this course at the beginning of February a lot of things happened in between, but this course got me going, this course helped me realise, I'd like to learn more! Later I started learning PHP, got an internship and I am starting a junior dev job in August.
So if you're reading this, unsure whether programming is or is not for you, give this course a try. Try to push yourself to do something an hour, two, or four each day after work. Don't quit until you finish the whole course. After being done with it, you'll know whether this is the right path for you!
I'd like to say a big thank you to Ardit!

Problem: I had no idea what is possible with python. Googling 'python project ideas' gave me nothing interesting, and even if it did I did not have a clue how to build it since I only know basic syntax. 

This course was perfect for me. I've skipped the basic syntax part and went directly to the projects. The instructor shows what kind of things are possible with python. I've gotten so many personal project ideas from this course, and I know now how to start working at them."
The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-07-27 11:53:47+00:00,4.5,"At the beginning, I think I should pass the basic things of Python. But it does refresh my knowledge about the Python Fundamental.

I think it should be more improved so the students can more understand what the narrator said without turn CC on."

I am just getting started now and I am going slow, but the materials I have reviewed and worked through so far are very impressive.  I am thrilled and grateful for the teacher's consistent sharing of new code and/or techniques that improve the overall course content."

I think, the examples and applications in the course gives the basic logic behind Python which is essential to proceed forward with your own ideas and improve your Python skills after finishing the course. The clarity of the courses is a big plus, they don't bore you with complex and intense sections. I recommend this course to people who wants to learn and productively use Python but doesn't know where to start and what are the capabilities of this language."

It's great, don't get me wrong, but the instructor didn't give any direction towards an alternative, i.e. straight in the text editor itself. The project I was most interested in, the web scraping, was all in Jupyter (which is pointless for me). Overall, the course was good, it's just not my style. I prefer coding in the text editor."

Instructors voice is clear and easy to understand. I could comfortably listen to lessons at 1,75x speed. 

In some sections (webmaps) the voice was mixed too quiet, so I had to turn up the volume, but it was a minor nuisance.

This course can give you an idea, it touches the water of what you can do with python. Another positive aspect is that you can get back to certain points if you are confused. Q&A sections solves most of the issues you can meet. 
Follow it step by step, think of something you can make use of and do your own application. My favourite one was with bokeh and pandas. I find it very practical. 
I didn't like one thing. The final app should be at the end of every app to set the knowledge into your head. 

Thank you very much!"

If you are teaching this much in two hours people will not remember that and will not be able to understand what is going on. If you give them tasks they will get more idea if they will do that task on their own.
The quiz after lectures are too basic . Anybody can answer those basic questions.

Accept above everything is good"

The Python Course: 100 Excercises for Beginners,2018-07-15 22:37:27+00:00,5.0,"The hard part about learning is that a topic seems clear when you're reading about it, but you don't often know what you don't know until you are challenged to solve a problem.  That is where this course is great, Ardit clearly put alot of time and thought into coming up nugget-sized problems that take anywhere from 1-20 minutes to solve in order to make sure that a topic is understood.

This course helped me immediately by making me aware of some things that I either wasn't aware existed, or that I said I would learn one day but never got around to learning:
-atom w/ platformio-ide-terminal plugin
-pandas
-tkinter
-pretty print

I am grateful for having took this course, as it has immediately improved my python capabilities."

另外雖然網站有教學如何使用google翻譯中文字幕，我個人英文程度也不是很好，但我絕大多數字幕都是觀看英文字幕，搭配翻譯以及網上搜尋相關資料，我認為觀看英文更能了解到一些專有名詞的英文詞彙，以及學習相關詞彙，能更好的搜尋資料，畢竟英文的相關資料還是大於中文的，因此也推薦直接觀看英文字幕。"

Ardit is a great tutor and his way of teaching is one of the best i have come across. There are good  number of exercises for practice and code. Will recommend anyone who wants to learn python and want to know how it can help us in real world.

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-06-06 23:18:36+00:00,5.0,"Excellent course.  Since I'm an intermediate user of Python, I skipped most of the earlier sections/lectures.  The later sections and lectures were challenging but he also gave good explanations and good examples to follow.

Also, he seems to care about his courses.  There was one or two videos that he said he had to redo because the library had changed so he didn't let this course mothball due to improvements/changes to the libraries.

The examples and exercises helped reinforce what he taught in the lectures.  I loved the real world application projects too, which are a step above the examples and exercises to further teach his points.

For me, coming up with ideas to practice what I learned is a little difficult so I love more exercises and projects to do but all in all, on a scale of 1-5, I give him a 12  :D"

What i do not like is that you are using command line instead of IDE such is pycharm that makes opening, viewing and reviewing files more efficient and looks much better. It also helps with beginner mistakes in typos and suggests already declared variables or available methods/functions, which makes things more efficient and easy to overview. But ok, intention is to learn to do things with command line. Let me do something practical now :)"

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-05-31 16:32:53+00:00,5.0,Good introduction
The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-05-31 14:24:40+00:00,4.5,"Lecturer words(speaking) are a bit unclear, i have to put strain on my hearing to understand the lecturer. 
The lecture videos are too short, example 2min, 5min, 8min. The video could have been about 10 minutes atleast by combining two or more sessions in one. 
In the lecture of first python program,  in addition to using the online service such as PythonAnywhere, tutor could have illustrated an example with a different method and the basic of getting python, simplest offline text editor like SublimeText(or else), then writing the code and then running python.
Rest i have to see and learn. 
Thank you for this Course."

I tried looking on line(couldn't find the answer) asked and posted my problem got 1 reply which I already but didn't work and never got any help after that. (This happened a few times) 

Also switching platforms and not giving directions on how to do something on another platform when it's different.  Since I'm a beginner and he was using windows(sometimes) and I'm using a mac, I spent hours trying to get a program to run and then him not saying or posting that to get it to run is a little different on a Mac.  Needed more directions for people that are complete beginners and using a different platform than what he's using.  

Also more exercises after lessons would be nice to practice what was taught.

Positives are that he goes over a lot of info."

Bear with my essay! I'm excited.
By the way I didn't pause on the course. I kept going. I needed it.

Thanks and thanks and thanks and thanks

Before now I have searched for a course on python since falling in love with the language years ago. There were just bits and pieces here and there but then along came Ardit! 

Here, I was able to piece together the different aspects of the language into something really functional. I can now go through codes I have sat down studying to no avail and immediately get what is happening. 

I know I have some ways to go in practicals but I am confident that I will do good because I know how to get dirty in things like this. 

Finally, I have a 18months old son and it turns me on to know that once he can add 2 and 2, we will do great things together and he will do greater for himself.

Thanks Ardit. I will have folks out here know that there is a great and REAL python course out there for real learning.

PS: I am a Filemaker developer and I do have solutions for school info mgt. Now I can host my own apps where my client schools can have a site for enrollment developed by myself while avoiding the cost and time to deliver same with FM. How beautiful.

Greetings from Lagos, Nigeria.
-Paschal.

Finaly I finished that cource! and I want to say THANKS! That is a really useful!
First that I want to say. English is not my native language and my level is not so good. But I didnt face with translate problems. Ardit is a good teacher (that may be important for some students)
The course was instructive. Ardit  explained with details sometime more then needed ;)
 I faced with a real projects. Especial good lessons was about Data and I going to learn more abot this
I strong recomend this cource for students who learning Python. Best way if you have some basic knowlege. If not - dont worry! This cource contain necessary lessons
PS
That cource should cost more;)"

By focusing on real-world applications, and exposure to multiple libraries, this course has helped me think ""what else can I do?"" with the applications taught.
Also useful, Ardit keeps any errors and exceptions made during programming instead of editing them out. This is really useful as he then proceeds to show how to problem-solve and debug the program. If I had any comments for Ardit it would be to keep the course live and up-to-date as I know I won't be the only one who will have a successful future programming thanks to his course, and thank you very much for putting it together."

Ardit definitely knows his stuff & goes to explain the process in a deep yet easily understood manner. I also like the fact that even the basic concepts seems to be leading to REAL WORLD scenarios & applications!

One thing that I also like about the teacher is that he does his best to answer my questions in both the Q & A and also via PM.

Ardit's lesson's are interesting, practical, and cover a wide variety of topics. His lessons are easy to follow.  I believe that his lessons garner an intuitive understanding of Python. 

The syntax in my version of Python differs a little from Ardit's but he did a good job leaving notes to help us out when we get lost.  But this definitely has been a source of frustration at a few points during this course. There are some sections that I have skipped due to these issues."

The only reasons that I have given four stars as opposed to higher is that some of the lessons feel a bit short and sometimes some of the lessons feel as though they have been 'sped' through.

Only downside is that as software has new versions some of the code will not work directly and you need to figure out what has changed. Though this is a problem with all software based courses it and it is mentioned in the Q&A at several chapters, it would be really great if a warning appears in the video, or  a Q&A post for each lecture where things have changed. Some issues were mentioned as far as 8 months back. The author has had ample time to figure out how to deal with this more effectively."

If I could ask him to maybe slow down the pace a little as I am a complete beginner in Python, that would have made the difference in giving a 5 star.
Needless to say, I am happy with what I have learned, and I know that I could always go through it again to make sure I fully understand the concepts for future app-building and to develop my python skills even more.

One thing I have to note is, having already taken another full introductory / more detailed course on Python basics I believe that made me more comfortable with the content of this course. So although I definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn python I would suggest that they first get slightly familiar with the language from another full on beginners course or just youtube videos."

I liked the fact that many different tools were used and I had the opportunity to see other implementations of Python code than just data analysis.
I highly recommend this course! I think it is even better for people who have at least basic programming skills. The instructor makes you like Python and makes programming fun :) Encourages to build your own projects and apps. I like this style of teaching."

I did make mistakes , I spent hours in a couple of section figuring out
why my code is not working or the results did not match the course 
output. I trusted your learning principles and applied them. It was this more than learning python that I take from this course, How to debug and troubleshoot your code.
I know it is hard to keep your course updated to current versions of python and its modules , but again working through the problems I could come up with a solution.
 This course  is worth more than the five stars."

Especially for those starting to learn, they pick up the wrong habits and get lost, frustrated when their code does not run due to typo and they have to retype everything again."

I started before Ardit updated the course with more in-depth Python basics classes in the first third of the course, but I went back and did those as well. But the first time around, I was lost in the beginning, and then as Ardit went through more real-world applications, my knowledge picked up speed pretty quickly. There were a couple of times I was stumped and couldn't figure things out because Ardit focuses more on Windows and I have a Mac, but I did finally figure out the problems, even if it was several videos (and a lot of Googling and Stackflowing) later. I really enjoyed the diverse applications, and I really, really enjoyed the web scraping, Postgres, and the last student-built application challenge! Great course: I would highly recommend it. Also, great bonuses!"

I did have considerable difficulty in understanding the instructor. I tried enabling the auto-generated English captions and they were pretty useless, though at times comical. The caption auto-generator was having more trouble than me understanding the instructor!

There was an instance where programming a feature was not explained well, if at all. Perhaps I missed a quick explanation but I didn't recall hearing much about the use and functionality of ""zip"" for example. That was in section 6, lecture 33.

I do realize that this was a free course and so I cannot say that I didn't get quite a bit out of the course, even with its minor shortcomings. 

The instructor clearly knows Python well and I am glad that I took the time to take this course. 

Thank you Mr. Sulce for taking the time to create the course and course materials."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-03-30 17:22:55+00:00,4.5,"This course makes for an awesome jump, from the beginner/entry level courses to buulding actual applications. I started Python on Codeacademy (excellent course, definitely recommended) and continued to Michele Pratusevich's ""Practice Python"" blog. After finishing those, I was still struggling to understand how to make something actually useful in Python. This course taught me many things I wanted to know (graphic interfaces, creating executables etc) and many more that I didn't know I wanted to know(Image Proccesing, Face Recognition, Databases, Working with Websites etc)! As for the course itself, it's being kept up to date continuously. Also Ardit really does read and answer every question in a reasonable timeframe. 

I understand that I wasn't a complete beginner when I started the course and my previous ""experience"" did help me, but even if you are starting from scratch you can actually learn everything without prior knowledge, especially with the recent addition of extra lessons at the start of the course.

I didn't gave 5 stars simply because I believe that there is always room for improvement. Nothing specific to complain, just sayin'. I did ran the whole course at 1.25-1.5 speed, as I found the pace a llittle slow, but it's definetely not Ardit's fault, he's not a native speaker. With that being said, I find his accent good enough, although other people seem to disagree.

All in all, this course helped me to get a firm grasp on Python. I wish all the best to Ardit and I look forward to his next course."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-03-29 03:00:52+00:00,5.0,"Hello Ardit,

You should consider adding a section at the beginning of the course where all Python add-ons / extensions are downloaded after the rest of the course. 

I know that it may seem unnecessary and the extensions should be fast and easy to install, but it is not always the case, as the python versions progress and the compatibilities change, the student must do a little research to be able to perform each installation, and it would be better if this process is done once and for all at the beginning of the course and not along it.

It was tedious to have to stop every ""n"" lectures to download new extensions, and even worse if there was an error installing any of them.

This is a small detail that does not affect the excellence of the course, I have enjoyed and learned a lot with your lessons.

Regards"

For example, Bokeh now deprecated the server_autoload function, the datetimetickerformatter cant take the 'formats' argument, etc. so you will need to search around a bit

In part I know this is due to Bokeh being such a new library and constantly updated but it comes with the territory I guess.

In any event I learned quite a lot, thanks!"

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-03-13 04:39:30+00:00,5.0,Excellent Course! I was very interested in the OpenCV section and was able to jump right in and get things running. There are not very many cohesive lessons found on the internet that are good for self learning that do not ultimately end up with errors and frustrations.  The OpenCV section walks you through the basics without problems. Some of the more advanced structures could use some more explanations but it's probably beyond the scope of this course. I'm VERY pleased!

Sarebbe utile una certa serie di riassunti e risorse da consultare per le nozioni inserite al volo. Tuttavia l'autore è preparato. (Scrivo questa nota quando sono alla lezione 155)

Thank you so much for creating this course. 
It's always better to practice and try to figure stuff out on your own, then watch another yt video. It worth the time investments and I will be probably re-doing it in the future just as a refresher.
Here is what I think can be improved:
- I assumed that with higher number the difficulty of tasks will grow. That is not the case, and instead we got a bunch of easy tasks and then sudden spike, especially towards the end,
But I understand that this course is rather topic-oriented,
- If the course is more topic-oriented give it bit more structure, like: 1-20 exercises on data structures, 40-60 databases etc.
- I'm missing OOP exercises: functions, classes, decorators, getters, setters etc.,
- Although the score shows I’m advanced, I’m definitely not :). something to calibrate?"

For the serious learner, there will be plenty of opportunities to learn to troubleshoot especially if you are working on a Mac (too much pain installing openCV and figuring out virtualenv). Hardware problems aside, the course is really epic and we cover a lot of ground throughout the course. 
For the absolute beginner (like me) I did get lost when it came to SQL and CSS and HTML - so it was a matter of copying code because I have no background in all of that. That was a little bit frustrating.
Thanks Ardit for putting this course together. So much hard work and even answering all the Q&As. Read the Q&As, be prepared to google to troubleshoot, and you will benefit from this course. Thanks again Ardit!"

Took this course after Python Mega course. Which means you can easily manage 80% of the problem set.  I dont recommend taking this course directly if you are a beginner. Rather go for Python Mega course and then in order to know how much you understood from PM  take this course. Ardit's content is awesome as always. Thanks again Ardit. --peace Vishwa."

The Python Course: Interactive Visualizations,2018-02-19 04:46:01+00:00,3.0,"**Updating my review  as the original sections 1 & 2 are now consolidated.  I didn't re-watch any of but the outline shows the hour of draggy material has been condensed down to 35 minutes.

I'm about 1/2 way through, will update as I make progress:

Pros: Content is solid, Ardits direction and the purpose of each exercise is clear.

Cons: Timing feels a little off as I have to watch most of the videos at 2x speed.  A bit annoying though is that Ardit executes the code right after he types it which then brings up another screen that blocks what was just typed.  This requires me to skip back and pause to see what he actually typed nearly every time.

Not really Ardits fault is that the changes to bokeh itself are occurring rapidly enough that little parts of his lessons sometimes don't have the shown outcome.  Be prepared to do some googling and reading through previously ask Q&As.  This in itself may be a good thing as I will probably retain the knowledge gain when I troubleshoot it myself rather than being spoon-fed :)"

The course so far, deep into section 2, is very comparable in quality to classes I've taken on Lynda.com but without the higher costs.

--Update:  I've reached deep into the course now after a few weeks and maintain my review of 5 stars for Ardit's course.  The value you will receive is well worth the small investment of money and time.  Should you purchase the course while it is on sale, I think you will agree that it is a steal!  If you are looking to get into Python or are already a seasoned developer, you should strongly consider this course and all that it has to offer."

The best thing about this course was he covered web app, desktop app and also deploying apps to cloud which with use of heroku makes it absolute breeze. At the end I was able to build the applications quite easily as all the things were already known to me. My suggestion would be to start teaching Machine Learning in Python as AI is currently at it's best."

It is structured extremely well, the explanations are very clear, and each section contains either quizzes or exercises that highlight key concepts and ideas. Some will force you to check earlier lectures, therefore reinforcing your learning. At each new section, exercises also contain elements from previous sections, therefore consolidating learning and gradually showing how different elements can be used together. This is much better for stepping up to building your own Python programs."

Therefore, there could be some extra sources, articles, material for other important features. But at the end, I definetely suggest the course."

I liked the structure of the course, theory + practice. Before completing the course, I began studying Python by books and I faced with a problem that I did not understand what to do with the knowledge I received, like Ok, here are the functions, methods, classes etc, and how to do something real, what is next? This course answered this question. I expanded my view on programming.
And besides, it heighten my interest in what am I doing now and the excitement to do something else, to create something by your own, pushed to think creatively. Ardit motivates you to search, work independently, supports when you face problems, easily communicates.
If you are looking for a course in which there are no meaningless chatter, the curriculum is composed from simple to complex, take this course without hesitation."

This Beginners course is the first one where I feel confident to start writing a very basic program in Python.  What is even more important is that I feel confident that I can grasp how Python works and this will help me to get a better understanding of the Python scripts that I have to deal with at work.  I definitely recommend this instructor and look forward to taking additional course offered by Ardit Sulce.  Thanks for putting together this excellent course."

The biggest plus of the course is that it is focused on real life usage. First you get theory and after that you quickly get an example how to use that theoretic knowledge in practice.

I also like the course tempo and depth of explanation.

In the begging tutor's accent was a bit distracting for me, but Ardit (tutor) knows English very well so I quickly got used to his accent. 

Good job Ardit. I really want more courses like that!"

It's a lot like teaching hacking by teaching students how to use kali linux hacking tools, instead of teaching them how to build hacking tools and why these tools do what they do."

First,
my thanks for the amount of teaching so well structured and so efficient, and the best, from simplicity and ease to learning.
Topics almost never addressed in a clear form and easily assimilated way.
For example: ""THE BUILDINGS""  - ""A webcam Motion Detector,  Website Blocker, Graphic User Interface With Tkinter. Face Detection  ... etc, etc."".
The course from start to finish: clear, and captivating, with practical and direct exercises.
Thank you UDEMY,
Thank you Ardet!

I think I would benefit from more in depth explanation about third party package documentation - for example, nothing was explained about folium ( in application 2). Also, in app2 , it is not intuitive how to get create {""fillColor"":""color""} function: how did the author find that ""fillColor"" needs to be filled? I am starting to think that instruction in this course does not generalize well but, rather, caters to these specific narrowly defined tasks. Finally, the author makes little effort to explain how to get data sources, API keys, etc for those of us who are curious and want to create similar applications but with more creativity."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-02-02 12:43:48+00:00,4.0,"This is a very practical course for those who know the basics of programming and want to learn Python and/or are basic / intermediate infrequent python users looking to up-skill to Python 3 for application building purposes more then scripting or analytics. A fresh ""new learner"" of programming would need to refer to other training sources first on OOP, programming in general, etc before doing the course BUT a little research would leave them ready for this course as its not too deep in any of its topics. Its a practical course full of useful tips and programmatic approaches for Python, which as a Java and C# programmer I have found to be very useful. Programming at this higher level of abstraction does not have the same control but the trade offs in terms of what your code can do is impressive once you learn the programmatic approach to Python that works. This is a central point to the course and sets up the able Developer for a very productive development experience in Python once exception handling and debugging in Python are understood on the engineering side.

UPDATE: lost 2 days trying to get around a Macos problem with Pyinstaller. No response from Ardit? Lack of response and not addressing the Pyinstaller issues on mac in that part of the course (Bookstore - tkinter app on Python 3.6.4) is reason why I dropped from a 5 star to a 4.5 star. Otherwise, still a good course!

UPDATE: some of the Bokeh lecture is outdated which led to research time to do it in an updated manner to get code to work. bkcharts for example is not supported and the library (v bokeh.charts) pre bokeh 0.12.6 does not work on mac. Instead, I used bokeh.plotting which Ardit is practically cover but the comparision was redundant. I learned that bokeh.plotting has been materially altered for increased functionality and http://holoviews.org/  is a library that more closely resembles boken.charts (gone) and bkcharts(not supported). Also, Ardit working from old versions of bokeh means that in figure() for example, perimeters have changed. Responsive=True is redundant with sizing_mode='scale_width' in its place like tgraph = figure(width=500, height=200, x_axis_type=""datetime"", title=""Motion Detection Graph"", sizing_mode='scale_width'). Its still a good and practical course, but Ardit needs to keep upto date with updates to libraries like Bokeh. Figuring it out for less experienced guys maybe too much as it did slow me up on a tight schedule... That said over 85% of the way through the course, its still earning a solid 4 stars!"

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-01-30 15:53:24+00:00,4.0,"Let me write first what I did not like. I tried to use Linux at the beginning of the course; the truth is that in theory it should work, and it does, but finding the workarounds takes a lot of time. At the end I had to turn to Windows to focus on python. Also, the OOP explanations were confusing; maybe time is too short to explain this concept. Finally, the last application proved kind of intractable; things like Postgresql have changed, interface is not the same, and the many details involved in this application, sometimes worked but sometimes I had problems, and finding the workarounds took a lot of time. 
What I liked? I learned a lot. This is a great course. The style of writing the code while thinking on the issues, sometimes with mishaps along the way, is real life like and better than explaining a set of already sanitized applications. The instructor, Ardit Sulze, knows python right and left (at least he knows a lot more than me!!) and it is interesting to observe how he finds solutions to tasks and issues along the way. Many good programming habits are embedded in it, like approaching a solution step by step, printing partial results, checking, etc. Again, this is a great course.
A fair evaluation for me would be in between 4 and 5 stars. All and all, if you want to learn, this course is an excellent investment of time and money. I thank the instructor for putting it together."

The Python Course: From Beginner to Expert,2018-01-26 09:19:40+00:00,4.0,"Please find the English review below!

Dieser Kurs bietet eine kurze, knackige Zusammenfassung der Python Grundlagen. Außerdem wird eines der Kernelemente von Python häufig in Szene gesetzt und ihre Wichtigkeit unterstrichen: Bibliotheken! Man erhält dadurch einen kurzen Einblick in die unzähligen Möglichkeiten, die einem diese Programmiersprache verschafft. Nichts desto trotz wird es notwendig sein, sich mit den einzelnen Teilen näher auseinanderzusetzen. Der Kurs gibt zumindest eine gute Richtung vor.

Empfehlen würde ich den Kurs dennoch tatsächlich eher Personen, die bereits Programmiererfahrung haben. Die hohe Geschwindigkeit des Kurses und der Akzent des Dozenten sind nicht jedermanns Sache. Der Inhalt ist zwar relativ linear aufgebaut, aber dennoch wirken manche Teile etwas verloren. Mehr Details und Kontext sind wünschenswert.

------------------------------------------------------------------

This course provides a short and firm summary of Python fundamentals. In addition, one of Python's core elements is often mentioned and its importance underlined: libraries! This gives you a brief insight into the countless possibilities of this programming language. Nevertheless, a closer look at the different parts is inevitable. But the course offers a good starting point.

I would rather recommend this course to people who already have programming experience. The high pace of the course and the accent of the lecturer may be problematic. The content is relatively linear, but some parts seem a bit lost. More details and context are desirable."

The web blocker does not enable me to specify a time range (only a problem for Mac users), the webcam doesn't capture movement (it just shows a rectangle all the time), and the data visualization app cannot import data from yahoo/google (the API is discontinued). This is a shame and I would imagine this is an easy fix for the instructor.  Compared to the Web Developer Bootcamp course, which updates way more comprehensively and frequently, this was a bit of a letdown. That being said, I believe this is a quick fix, and I hope it gets sorted soon to benefit future customers."

The instructor gives lots of tips that I hadn't seen in (introduction) textbooks on python. I liked the small exercises that are suggested between sessions in order to practice the information given during the lectures. I also liked that during the later sessions, the instructor let's you think/play with the code before giving the solution to the exercise. I really recommend this class to those with small experience with Python (or other programming languages)."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-01-20 01:06:54+00:00,5.0,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE! BUT PLEASE READ THE REST OF THE REVIEW!

This is a phenomenal course for anyone who wants to learn Python, but also wants to apply this language to real life applications. 

Being a newbie to Python (background in PHP), I want to learn all the possible uses of Python before I decide the type of Python programming that I would like to specialize in. This course will give you a broad understanding of the capabilities of Python. 

If you read the negative reviews of this course, you will see that people all have the same comment; the course does not go in depth with topics.

If there you have a specific need, or are looking to peel off all the layers that Python has to offer, this course if not for you. I would highly recommend looking at other courses that are geared towards what you are looking to accomplish (Web Design, Data Analysis, etc). 

I've had instructors in other courses that were extremely difficult to follow along.  This instructor has a German (I think?) accent, but you can definitely understand him. 

What makes this course great is that he gives you quizzes in between important topics, which give you a better understanding of where you're at in the course. He will also outline areas that he feels you should revisit. 

He also gives you exercises, that are a bit challenging. I highly recommend you take the time to try the exercises, especially if you are a newbie to programming. 

You need to get into the mindset of a developer, and be able to put what you've learned to the test. You won't have an instructor telling you how to do something in the real world, and the only way you get better is by practicing. What you get out of this, or any course, is based on how much you put in. This is the best advice I can give.

Hope this review helps! Enjoy!"

""oh, we got an error, but it's not the one we are talking about"", 
""ah, it's trown an error becuse I made a typo in the code...""

Some things are only explained in QA, and were totally left out in lectures. Like hitting Enter in Terminal twice to let Python know that you're done with the loop. That's not something you can brainstorm - you have to know that Terminal commands work this way.

Sorry, it's not how you teach people. All they remember afer that is going back an forth fixing errors. There are no doubts that instructor knows the subject - he fixes his own errors on the fly. But it's not good for newbies. It's confusing. 

If a video has non-subject errors or is missing something, please record it again before publishing and make sure that it's flawless."

This course is excellent in going over the basics before diving into actual apps that use the methods learned earlier in the course. The apps are varied and give the student a broad base of skills to draw from. I personally took a few of the apps and combined them into a personal app later on (my own flask based website using a database hosted on Heroku where users can generate their own maps and routes to locations using the Bing API).

My only gripe with the course (apart from the fact I would like more of it, because it was so good) is that sometimes we would start to learn a new library without an understanding for the purpose of that library. Once we start making the app that uses said library it clicks and you understand, but until then it's a bit like 'Ok we are learning this but I'm not sure why/how it's useful'

Overall this course is great for anybody that wants to learn whilst building something."

Il corso mi è piaciuto molto ed è fatto in maniera professionale.
Ci sono video brevi in cui si spiegano i passaggi più semplici o dove vengono date dimostrazioni di cosa si andrà a fare successivamente e video un po' più lunghi con passaggi spiegati dettagliatamente.

Ottimo video corso!!!"

The introduction to core Python data types/manipulations in this course does not prepare you well for the following lectures. The content is incredibly valuable and all the concepts are explained quite simply, making them easy to follow and comprehend. However, there is not enough depth of explanation to allow you to play around with the concepts on your own, which is the best way to learn. The course goes for breadth rather than depth, and the students' practical ability suffers as result. Worth taking if you don't mind relying heavily on supplemental resources to fully understand things."

The point of this course is that Ardit not only shows you the final code, but also build the project literally step-by-step: He would also have typo, error, and he shows the process of fixing them -- it is just like the real world!
Thank you Ardit!

Another thought: I think now Jupyter is the mainstream for building small projects, so if students who are confused of Atom in the course can just code everything on Jupyter just as I did."

To be honest, I couldn't do a number of them without a bit of web searching which of course we do in the real world.

The fun part was to compare how I did them compared to how Ardit, the instructor, did them, which was most often more concise than mine. There were a number of times where I chose to expand the exercises outside of the assignment.

They results form a nice notebook of howtos for the future.  I'm glad I took this course."

The only thing that one should concern is, if you are going to depend *solely* on subtitles to understand what the instructor is saying, then you'll not understand anything as the subtitles are auto-generated and are really terrible.
Even though I understood the course without using subtitles, at some points I could not understand his accent (it was usually in the theory part, but practicals are easy to understand, so don't worry). 

Otherwise this course is excellent!! Nicely explained. I would definitely recommend it for not just beginners but at all levels, cause *this course covers basics in GIS very well* Thanks Ardit for clearing the basic concepts in the best possible way!"

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-01-09 23:16:58+00:00,5.0,"I like the focus of course on practical problems not some imaginary mathematical problems which are useless in real world. Exercises are on right level which will force student to actually think, first few were easy because of my previous programming experience, beginner may struggle. I would like to point that a bit later, some exercises gave me a tiny bit headache. All in all great course for those who value hands on experience rather than just raw theory.

I would also like to advise those who take this course, after few lessons sit down and create a basic program, such as calculator or some form of converter, you'll be surprised how much you will learn if you apply everything you have went through in course and  if you have eye for details."

The Python Course: AI/ML in Python,2018-01-08 20:49:04+00:00,4.5,"This was a super solid course that went over a ton of python application work.  Ardit started from the beginning and walked through some pretty sophisticated code bases.  When problems arose, the Q&A had a lot of help and for new questions, Ardit responding in a day.

While the main building block topics I had experience in, putting them to use building things that are practical was my main draw to the course.  I never worked with a database in my Python work and we learned about two ways to do it (PostgreSQL and SQLite).  Similar for building graphs, we had projects that showed two ways (Folium and bokeh) to d that.  Finally, we pushed some of the programs we built to the web in a live webserver.

The final project was a good build on all the bits and pieces we put together in the course.  The final project and a couple of the smaller ones will go on my ""home page.""

I would highly recommend this course to anyone that is looking to program in Python with some real applications.

Why not five stars?  Well pandas and numpy were really glossed over and those are critical packages for handling anything having to do with analytics.  But it was enough to get me started."

I design and train courses for electronics technicians and I must say that this course is spot on for learning python.  In depth, but not so much as to be confusing and instructions on where to find more info if you want.

The only improvement that I would suggest is some sort of downloadable assignment sheet with the student project at the end.  Something that students can refer back to to see what they need to accomplish without having to watch a lecture again and again.

Overall my favorite Udemy course to date."

I like that the instructor was thoughtful in intentionally showing errors in order for us to see them and have advice on the approach on fixing them. The pace was great and I really feel accomplished after this course.

Some improvements could be having more programming exercises like in the beginning of the course and not just showing the whole application. Update some of the instructions since some of the modules (like bokeh) have changed and it would be nice to keep in sync if possible to minimize any confusion. Any unintentional bugs, typos, and errors would be nice to be cut out of the videos or re-recorded for a cleaner experience. What I would of liked too is introducing some advanced data structures or even sorting algorithms."

The Python Course: Interactive Visualizations,2018-01-05 13:27:40+00:00,4.0,"Excellent introduction to the Bokeh library, very much enjoyable. Also, I sped most of the lectures to 1.25x or 1.5x sometimes as I found the pace to be a little too slow. Even at 1.25x I could follow the instructor's reasoning and code along perfectly.

As for improvement suggestions, perhaps an additional introductory lecture on configuring a web server would help. I got a little bit confused on convincing Nginx, Flask and Bokeh server to play well together, but nothing that some debugging and tinkering here and there could not solve. Not really a Bokeh issue and therefore out of scope for this course, but still... could have been a little bit more modularized so learners like me get a grasp on what to look for in other settings (I used a different stack than the instructor's DigitalOcean account). The troubleshooting lecture assumes the necessary pieces of software and configuration files are already in place, which may or may not be true.

I would definitely recommend the course and will certainly look for other offerings by Ardit in the future.

Best regards!"

However, there are too many really simple 'one-liner' questions or spotting syntax or other simple errors in given code, which take seconds to cover.  I'd have been happier if the entire course was programming exercise based, rather than a significant part being 'spot the error' - which I'm pleased I could spot quickly and in my head, but I was expecting more depth than these.

At the reduced price, however, it's a no-brainer; there's a couple of hours of good exercises to do, and it's confidence-building to have these to work on."
